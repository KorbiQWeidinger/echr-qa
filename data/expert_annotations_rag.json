    "question": "How does the Court apply Article 17 of the Convention to cases involving denial of the Holocaust and what factors does the Court consider in determining the manifestly ill-founded nature of the applicants' complaints under Article 10?",
    "answer": "In a case concerning Holocaust denial, whether the Court applies Article 17 directly, declaring a complaint incompatible ratione materiae, or instead finds Article 10 applicable, invoking Article 17 at a later stage when it examines the necessity of the alleged interference, is a decision taken on a case- by-case basis and will depend on all the circumstances of each individual case (Past\u00f6rs v. Germany, 2019, \u00a7 37). In those cases it was faced with statements, almost invariably emanating from persons professing Nazi-like views or linked with Nazi-inspired movements, that cast doubt on the reality of the persecution and extermination of millions of Jews under the Nazi regime; claimed that the Holocaust was a lie, contrived as a means of political extortion; denied the existence of the concentration camps or justified it; or claimed either that the gas chambers in those camps had never existed or that the number of persons killed in them was highly exaggerated and technically impossible. The Commission, frequently referring to the historical experience of the States concerned, described such statements as attacks on the Jewish community, which ran counter to justice and peace and further reflected racial and religious discrimination. After recalling its Article 17 case-law, the Court rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 10 as manifestly ill-founded. The applicant could not have been unaware that his statements were capable of casting doubt as to the extent of the extermination of the Jews during the Second World War, especially in the context of a debate raging at the university due to negationist and racist views defended by some of its teaching staff. His possible contribution to the negationist discourse and the resulting disorder within the university had been incompatible with his duties and responsibilities as a teacher. The Court attached fundamental importance to the fact that the applicant had planned his speech in advance, deliberately resorting to obfuscation to get his message across. Article 17 had thus an important role to play, as the applicant had sought to use his right to freedom of expression with the aim of promoting ideas contrary to the text and spirit of the Convention and that weighed heavily in the assessment of the necessity of the interference. The applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 10 was eventually rejected as manifestly ill-founded.",

          "37": ". The Court reiterates that Article 17 is only applicable on an exceptional basis and in extreme cases and should, in cases concerning Article 10 of the Convention, only be resorted to if it is immediately clear that the impugned statements sought to deflect this Article from its real purpose by employing the right to freedom of expression for ends clearly contrary to the values of the Convention (see Perin\u00e7ek , cited above, \u00a7 114). The decisive point when assessing whether statements, verbal or non-verbal, are removed from the protection of Article 10 by Article 17, is whether those statements are directed against the Convention\u2019s underlying values, for example by stirring up hatred or violence, or whether by making the statement, the author attempted to rely on the Convention to engage in an activity or perform acts aimed at the destruction of the rights and freedoms laid down in it (see ibid., \u00a7 115; and Roj TV A/S , cited above, \u00a7 31). In a case concerning Holocaust denial, whether the Court applies Article 17 directly, declaring a complaint incompatible ratione materiae , or instead finds Article 10 applicable, invoking Article 17 at a later stage when it examines the necessity of the alleged interference, is a decision taken on a case-by-case basis and will depend on all the circumstances of each individual case."

    "question": "Based on the severity test and the criteria for applying Article 8, how does the Court differentiate between acts or measures that give rise to an interference with the right to respect for private life and those that do not?",
    "answer": "The Court declared the application inadmissible ratione materiae. The Court also applied the above-mentioned severity test in cases involving identity checks, allegedly based on physical or ethnic motives. That threshold is only attained if the person concerned has an arguable claim that he or she may have been targeted on account of specific physical or ethnic characteristics. In this connection, the Court observed that the public nature of the check might have an effect on a person\u2019s reputation and self-respect (Basu v. Germany, 2022, \u00a7\u00a7 25-27; Muhammad v. Spain, 2022, \u00a7\u00a7 49-51). Not every act or measure which may be said to affect adversely the moral integrity of a person necessarily gives rise to such an interference. However, once a measure is found to have seriously affected the applicant\u2019s private life, the complaint will be compatible ratione materiae with the Convention and an issue of the \u201cright to respect for private life\u201d will arise. In this regard, the question of applicability and the existence of interference with the right to respect for private life are often inextricably linked (Vu\u010dina v. Croatia (dec.), 2019, \u00a7 32).",

Having regard to these principles, the Court considers that not every identity check of a person belonging to an ethnic minority attains the necessary threshold of severity so as to fall within the ambit of the right to respect for that person\u2019s private life. That threshold is only attained if the person concerned has an arguable claim that he or she may have been targeted on account of specific physical or ethnic characteristics. Such an arguable claim may notably exist where the person concerned submitted that he or she (or persons having the same characteristics) had been the only person(s) subjected to a check and where no other grounds for the check were apparent or where any explanations of the officers carrying out the check disclose specific physical or ethnic motives for the check. The Court further observes in this regard that the public nature of the check may have an effect on a person\u2019s reputation (see paragraph 23 above) and self-respect.",
          "26": ". The Court notes that the applicant had been subjected to an identity check by the police in public, on a train. In the applicant\u2019s submission, that check had only been carried out because of his dark skin colour and thus on racial grounds. He substantiated that allegation by his observation that of the persons present in different compartments of the train carriage, he and his daughter had been the only persons with a dark skin colour and the only persons who had been subjected to the check. Furthermore, the explanations given by the police officer who had carried out the check had not disclosed any other objective grounds for targeting the applicant. The Court therefore cannot agree with the Government\u2019s argument that in these circumstances, there was no arguable claim that the applicant had been targeted on account of specific physical or ethnic characteristics. The applicant further argued that the identity check under these conditions had had serious negative effects on his private life as he had felt so stigmatised and humiliated that he had stopped travelling by train for several months.",
          "27": ". The Court considers that the applicant substantiated his argument that the identity check by the police under these special circumstances had had sufficiently serious consequences for his right to respect for his private life.

The Court also notes that an identity check by the police can fall within the scope of the private life of the person subjected to that check, and therefore, constitute an interference in that person\u2019s private life as protected by Article 8 of the Convention. In particular, the Court has found that the use of coercive powers conferred by legislation to require an individual to submit to an identity check and a detailed search of his person, his clothing and his personal belongings amounted to an interference with the right to respect for private life (see Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom , no. 4158/05, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2010 (extracts), and Vig v. Hungary , no. 59648/13, \u00a7 49, 14 January 2021).

According to his submission, that check had only been carried out because of his dark skin colour and thus on racial grounds. The identity check necessarily affected the applicant\u2019s private life, and would have been sufficient to affect his psychological integrity and ethnic identity, for the purposes of Article 8 of the Convention (see Kir\u00e1ly and D\u00f6m\u00f6t\u00f6r v.

In certain contexts, the Court has considered it necessary to specifically examine whether the effects of the act in question attained a threshold of severity \u2013 that is, had serious negative effects on the individual\u2019s private life \u2013 in order for Article 8 to be applicable (see, in particular, Denisov v. Ukraine, no. 76639/11, \u00a7\u00a7 110-13, 25 September 2018). It has ruled, for instance, that an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be carried out in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life in order for Article 8 to come into play (see, inter alia , B\u00e9dat v.

In Denisov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 112-14), the Grand Chamber held that in such cases the effects of the statement or act must rise above a certain \u201cthreshold of severity\u201d. Although the specific issue in Denisov was whether a dismissal from one\u2019s professional position could engage Article 8, the broader point made there has subsequently been applied in cases raising very different issues.

In Beizaras and Levickas v. Lithuania (no. 41288/15, \u00a7 117, 14 January 2020), which concerned a matter much closer to the one under examination here, the Court found that violently homophobic statements made under a photograph published on the applicants\u2019 Facebook page had attained a sufficient level of seriousness to affect their \u201cprivate life\u201d, and that Article 8 was thus engaged in respect of those statements. The Court emphasised in that connection that for Article 8 to come into play, an attack on a person must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of the right to respect for one\u2019s private life (ibid., \u00a7 109).

It appears, however, necessary to spell out more explicitly the kinds of considerations which may have a bearing on the assessment of that question. They can be inferred from the Court\u2019s findings in those cases, albeit not expressly articulated therein. Some guidance can also be derived from the Court\u2019s general approach to the applicability of Article 8 of the Convention in cases in which the assertion is that a person\u2019s \u201cprivate life\u201d has been negatively affected by a statement or an act. In Denisov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 112-14), the Grand Chamber held that in such cases the effects of the statement or act must rise above a certain \u201cthreshold of severity\u201d. Although the specific issue in Denisov was whether a dismissal from one\u2019s professional position could engage Article 8, the broader point made there has subsequently been applied in cases raising very different issues. For instance, in Hudorovi\u010d and Others v. Slovenia (nos. 24816/14 and 25140/14, \u00a7\u00a7 115 and 157, 10 March 2020), which concerned access to safe drinking water and sanitation by members of the Roma minority, the Court expressly referred to Denisov (\u00a7 114) and then relied on it to emphasise that the State\u2019s alleged failure to provide the applicants with access to safe drinking water would only raise an issue under Article 8 if there was convincing evidence that this failure had effectively eroded their core rights under that provision. In Beizaras and Levickas v. Lithuania (no. 41288/15, \u00a7 117, 14 January 2020), which concerned a matter much closer to the one under examination here, the Court found that violently homophobic statements made under a photograph published on the applicants\u2019 Facebook page had attained a sufficient level of seriousness to affect their \u201cprivate life\u201d, and that Article 8 was thus engaged in respect of those statements. The Court emphasised in that connection that for Article 8 to come into play, an attack on a person must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of the right to respect for one\u2019s private life (ibid., \u00a7 109). In contrast, in Vu\u010dina v.

    "question": "In a case where a Contracting State exercises effective control over an area outside its national territory, what are the criteria under Article 1 of the Convention that establish the State's responsibility to secure the rights set out in the Convention within that area?",
    "answer": "The fact that the local administration survives as a result of the Contracting State\u2019s military and other support entails that State\u2019s responsibility for its policies and actions. The controlling State has the responsibility under Article 1 to secure, within the area under its control, the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which it has ratified. It will be liable for any violations of those rights exactly in the same way as if those violations had occurred strictly speaking on its own territory (Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], 2001, \u00a7\u00a7 76-77; Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2011, \u00a7 138; Catan and Others v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia [GC], 2012, \u00a7 106; Ukraine and the Netherlands v. Russia [GC] (dec.), 2022, \u00a7 561). Furthermore, where a Contracting State exercises overall control over an area outside its national territory, its responsibility is not confined to the acts of its soldiers or officials in that area but also extends to acts of the local administration which survives there by virtue of its military and other support (Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], 2001, \u00a7 77; Ila\u015fcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], 2004, \u00a7 316). In such a case, where there is effective control over an area, the State will have jurisdiction ratione loci (Ukraine and the Netherlands v. Russia [GC] (dec.), 2022, \u00a7 561). The question whether a Contracting State is genuinely exercising effective control over a territory outside its borders is one of fact. In seeking to answer that question the Court primarily has regard to the following two criteria: \u25aa the number of soldiers deployed by the State in the territory in question; this is the criterion to which the Court had hitherto attached the greatest importance (Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 56; Ila\u015fcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], 2004, \u00a7 387); \u25aa the extent to which the State\u2019s military, economic and political support for the local subordinate administration provides it with influence and control over the region (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 388-394; Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2011, \u00a7 139).",

However, it is to be observed that the Court's reasoning is framed in terms of a broad statement of principle as regards Turkey's general responsibility under the Convention for the policies and actions of the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities. Having effective overall control over northern Cyprus, its responsibility cannot be confined to the acts of its own soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but must also be engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survives by virtue of Turkish military and other support. It follows that, in terms of Article 1 of the Convention, Turkey's \u201cjurisdiction\u201d must be considered to extend to securing the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which she has ratified, and that violations of those rights are imputable to Turkey."

Firstly, the acts of diplomatic and consular agents, who are present on foreign territory in accordance with provisions of international law, may amount to an exercise of jurisdiction when these agents exert authority and control over others. Secondly, the Court has recognised the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction by a Contracting State when, through the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the government of that territory, it exercises all or some of the public powers normally to be exercised by that government. Where, in accordance with custom, treaty or other agreement, authorities of the Contracting State perform executive or judicial duties on the territory of another State, the Contracting State may be responsible for any breaches of the Convention thereby incurred, as long as the acts in question are attributable to it rather than to the territorial State. In addition, in certain circumstances, the use of force by a State\u2019s agents operating outside its territory may bring the individual thereby brought under the control of the State\u2019s authorities into the State\u2019s Article 1 jurisdiction. It is clear that whenever the State, through its agents, exercises control and authority over an individual, and thus jurisdiction, the State is under an obligation under Article 1 to secure to that individual the rights and freedoms under Section I of the Convention that are relevant to his or her situation.

It was for Contracting States to decide the extent to which all or some of the Convention rights were extended to overseas territories for whose international relations they were responsible. The concept of \u201cState agent authority or control\u201d and \u201ceffective control over an area\u201d were not intended by the Court to supplant the declaratory system put in place by Article 56. The fact that the Contracting State was responsible for the international relations of an overseas territory and therefore might exercise a degree of control over certain of its governmental functions did not mean that all overseas territories fell within the jurisdiction of that Contracting State for the purposes of Article 1. Otherwise, the Convention would effectively be applicable to all overseas territories of a Contracting State regardless of the local requirements of the territory in question. Such construction would supplant and replace the system of declarations established under Article 56. The Court in Al-Skeini expressly stated that it was not doing so."

Firstly, the acts of diplomatic and consular agents, who are present on foreign territory in accordance with provisions of international law, may amount to an exercise of jurisdiction when these agents exert authority and control over others. Secondly, the Court has recognised the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction by a Contracting State when, through the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the government of that territory, it exercises all or some of the public powers normally to be exercised by that government. Where, in accordance with custom, treaty or other agreement, authorities of the Contracting State perform executive or judicial duties on the territory of another State, the Contracting State may be responsible for any breaches of the Convention thereby incurred, as long as the acts in question are attributable to it rather than to the territorial State. In addition, in certain circumstances, the use of force by a State\u2019s agents operating outside its territory may bring the individual thereby brought under the control of the State\u2019s authorities into the State\u2019s Article 1 jurisdiction. It is clear that whenever the State, through its agents, exercises control and authority over an individual, and thus jurisdiction, the State is under an obligation under Article 1 to secure to that individual the rights and freedoms under Section I of the Convention that are relevant to his or her situation. In this sense, therefore, the Convention rights can be \u201cdivided and tailored\u201d (see Al-Skeini and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 133-37, and the cases cited therein, and Georgia v.

    "question": "How does the Court determine whether a restriction on the right to vote and the right to stand for election, as guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, is compatible with the principle of the rule of law and the general objectives of the Convention, considering the political evolution of the country concerned and the criteria of arbitrariness, lack of proportionality, and interference with the free expression of the opinion of the people?",
    "answer": "There is room for \u201cimplied limitations\u201d, and the Contracting States must be given a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere. The concept of \u201cimplied limitations\u201d under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 is of major importance for the determination of the relevance of the aims pursued by the restrictions on the rights guaranteed by this provision. In examining compliance with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Court has focused mainly on two criteria: whether there has been arbitrariness or a lack of proportionality, and whether the restriction has interfered with the free expression of the opinion of the people. In addition, it underlines the need to assess any electoral legislation in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned, which means that unacceptable features in one system may be justified in another (Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, 1987, \u00a7 52; \u017ddanoka v. Latvia [GC], 2006, \u00a7\u00a7 103-104 and 115). The Court has held that post-election phases must be surrounded by precise procedural safeguards; the process must be transparent and open, and observers from all parties must be allowed to participate, including opposition representatives. It pointed out, however, that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 was not conceived as a code on electoral matters designed to regulate all aspects of the electoral process. Thus the Court\u2019s level of scrutiny in a given case depended on the aspect of the right to free elections. Tighter scrutiny should be reserved for any departures from the principle of universal suffrage, but a broader margin of appreciation could be afforded to States where the measures prevented candidates from standing for elections.",

III, p. 264, and vol. IV, p. 24). They have a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere, but it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Protocol No. 1 (P1) have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see, amongst other authorities and mutatis mutandis, the Lithgow and Others judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, p. 71, \u00a7 194). In particular, such conditions must not thwart \"the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\"."

Nonetheless, these rights are not absolute. There is room for \u201cimplied limitations\u201d, and Contracting States must be given a margin of appreciation in this sphere.

There are numerous ways of organising and running electoral systems and a wealth of differences, inter alia, in historical development, cultural diversity and political thought within Europe, which it is for each Contracting State to mould into its own democratic vision (see Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a02) [GC], no. 74025/01, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2005-IX).",

In particular, any such conditions must not thwart the free expression of the people in the choice of the legislature \u2013 in other words, they must reflect, or not run counter to, the concern to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of an electoral procedure aimed at identifying the will of the people through universal suffrage (see Hirst, cited above, \u00a7 62).",

    "answer": "Given the variety of means available to achieve restitutio in integrum and the nature of the issues involved, in the exercise of its competence under Article 46 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the Committee of Ministers is considered to be better placed than the Court to assess the specific measures to be taken. It is thus for the Committee of Ministers to supervise, on the basis of the information provided by the respondent State and with due regard to the applicant\u2019s evolving situation, the adoption of such measures that are feasible, timely, adequate and sufficient to ensure the maximum possible reparation for the violations found by the Court (Ilgar Mammadov v. Azerbaijan [GC], 2019, \u00a7 155).3 The Committee is the executive body of the Council of Europe and as such its work has a political character. That said, when supervising the execution of judgments it is fulfilling a particular task which consists of applying the relevant legal rules. The execution process concerns compliance by a Contracting Party with its obligations in international law under Article 46 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Those obligations are based on the principles of international law relating to cessation, non-repetition and reparation as reflected in the ARSIWA. Accordingly, the supervision mechanism under Article 46 of the Convention provides a comprehensive framework for the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments, reinforced by the Committee of Ministers\u2019 practice. Within that framework, the Committee\u2019s continuous supervision work has generated a corpus of public documents encompassing information submitted by respondent States and others concerned by the execution process, and recording decisions taken by the Committee in cases pending before it. That practice has also influenced general standard-setting in the Committee\u2019s Recommendations to the Member States on topics relevant to execution issues (for example Recommendation R (2000) 2 on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights4, or Recommendation CM/Rec(2010)3 on effective remedies for excessive length of proceedings5).",

    "question": "How does the margin of appreciation apply to the State's discretion in cases concerning the recognition of filiation between children and persons with whom they have no biological link, particularly when the child-parent bond is touched?",
    "answer": "The margin of appreciation is wide in cases concerning the recognition in law of filiation between children and persons with whom they have no biological link. However, the margin may be reduced when the child-parent bond is touched. This is particularly the case of the bond of filiation, which unites a person to his parent, especially when this person is a minor. Moreover, even when the State is within its margin, its decisions are not beyond the control of the Court, which will undertake a careful examination of the arguments to ensure that an appropriate balance has been struck with regard to the child\u2019s interests (C.E. and Others v. France, 2022, \u00a7\u00a7 85-90). Article 8 requires that the domestic authorities strike a fair balance between the interests of the child and those of the parents and that, in the balancing process, particular importance should be attached to the best interests of the child, which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parents (see the recapitulation of the general principles in Abdi Ibrahim v. Norway [GC], 2021, \u00a7 145).",

Where a particularly important facet of an individual\u2019s existence or identity is at stake, the margin allowed to the State will be narrow. Where, however, there is no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe, either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, particularly where the case raises sensitive moral or ethical issues, the margin will be wider. It will in general be wider where the State is required to strike a balance between competing private and public interests or Convention rights (see, in particular, A.P., Gar\u00e7on and Nicot v. France , nos. 79885/12 and 2 others, \u00a7 121, 6 April 2017; H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen , cited above, \u00a7 67, and the authorities cited therein; and the Advisory opinion concerning the recognition in domestic law of a legal parent-child relationship between a child born through a gestational surrogacy arrangement abroad and the intended mother [GC], request no.

The Court observes that the present applications, which concern the recognition of a legal parent-child relationship between children and individuals to whom they are not biologically related, raise a number of ethical issues. It further notes that the applicants did not dispute the Government\u2019s statement to the effect that there was no European consensus on the establishment of a legal parent-child relationship between a child and his or her biological mother\u2019s former female partner .",

This is especially the case with regard to the legal relationship between an individual and his or her parent, particularly where the individual is a minor.",
          "89": ". The respondent State therefore had a narrower margin of appreciation when it came to examining the situation of the children, M.B. and T.G. (compare Mennesson , cited above, \u00a7 80; see also the Advisory opinion , cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45).",
          "90": ". Moreover, the choices made by the State \u2013 even within the limits of this margin \u2013 are not beyond the scrutiny of the Court, to which it falls to examine carefully the arguments taken into consideration and leading to the solution reached and to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the competing interests at stake. In doing so, it must have regard to the essential principle according to which, whenever the situation of a child is in issue, the best interests of that child are paramount (see, for example, Mennesson , cited above, \u00a7 81).

Even so, that was not sufficient to limit the applicant\u2019s parental rights towards the child. On this point the District Court relied on the Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that in such cases the child\u2019s best interests were of paramount concern. This had two aspects: on the one hand, it was necessary to ensure that the child grew in a safe environment, and that in no circumstances could a mother have recourse to measures which could harm the child\u2019s health and development (the court relied on Johansen v. Norway, 7\u00a0August 1996, \u00a7\u00a078, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III). On the other hand, it was also obvious that the best interests of the child were to grow with his family, unless it was proven that the family was inappropriate, because to do otherwise would mean separating the child from his roots. Moreover, even though the national authorities had wide discretion when deciding whether to give the child to his or her biological parents, the family connection could be restricted only in \u201cparticularly special circumstances\u201d and everything had to be done in order to safeguard the personal connection and, if and when possible, \u201crestore the family\u201d (the court cited Amanalachioai v.

According to them, this was a presumption applicable to relationships based on biological ties, to prevent conflicts arising from the recognition of dual relationships of the same nature, which only made sense within the framework of kinship by blood. The Government referred to the opinion delivered by the Court of Cassation on 7 March 2018 to the effect that the lower court could not deliver a document attesting to a matter of common knowledge establishing de facto enjoyment of status in favour of the same-sex partner of a parent with whom a legal parent-child relationship had already been established (see paragraph 18 above), and pointed out that the creation of dual relationships with parents of the same sex was only possible through adoption."

The Government furthermore explained that the mechanism of de facto enjoyment of status did not permit recognition of a legal parent-child relationship in circumstances such as those in the present case. They clarified that this mechanism was used extremely rarely as a means of establishing parent-child relationships (currently fewer than ten cases per year) and was mainly used to obtain recognition of one\u2019s status as an heir with regard to one\u2019s father when he had not legally recognised his children, and in the case of children born out of wedlock whose father had died before they were born, without having legally recognised them. They argued that de facto enjoyment of status, which appeared under Book 1, Title VII of the Civil Code, entitled \u201clegal parent-child relationships\u201d, had been designed and developed with reference to blood ties or, at the very least, on the basis of the heterosexual reality of parent-child relationships. They submitted that it was thus designed, in principle, for the legal recognition of a pre-existing parent-child relationship and not to establish a relationship the sole basis for which was the claimants\u2019 wishes. According to them, this was a presumption applicable to relationships based on biological ties, to prevent conflicts arising from the recognition of dual relationships of the same nature, which only made sense within the framework of kinship by blood. The Government referred to the opinion delivered by the Court of Cassation on 7 March 2018 to the effect that the lower court could not deliver a document attesting to a matter of common knowledge establishing de facto enjoyment of status in favour of the same-sex partner of a parent with whom a legal parent-child relationship had already been established (see paragraph 18 above), and pointed out that the creation of dual relationships with parents of the same sex was only possible through adoption."

LITHUANIA; \u00a7 41: The court acknowledged N.V.\u2019s arguments that a close connection had been established between her and the applicant\u2019s daughter, and that she loved the child and had the complete ability to take care of her. Even so, that was not sufficient to limit the applicant\u2019s parental rights towards the child. On this point the District Court relied on the Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that in such cases the child\u2019s best interests were of paramount concern. This had two aspects: on the one hand, it was necessary to ensure that the child grew in a safe environment, and that in no circumstances could a mother have recourse to measures which could harm the child\u2019s health and development (the court relied on Johansen v. Norway, 7\u00a0August 1996, \u00a7\u00a078, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III). On the other hand, it was also obvious that the best interests of the child were to grow with his family, unless it was proven that the family was inappropriate, because to do otherwise would mean separating the child from his roots. Moreover, even though the national authorities had wide discretion when deciding whether to give the child to his or her biological parents, the family connection could be restricted only in \u201cparticularly special circumstances\u201d and everything had to be done in order to safeguard the personal connection and, if and when possible, \u201crestore the family\u201d (the court cited Amanalachioai v.

RUSSIA; \u00a7 42: In this connection, the Court reiterates that the right to protection of one\u2019s reputation is covered by Article 8 of the Convention as part of the right to respect for private life (see Chauvy and Others v. France, no.\u00a064915/01, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 2004-VI; Pfeifer v. Austria, no. 12556/03, \u00a7 35, 15\u00a0November 2007; Polanco Torres and Movilla Polanco v. Spain, no.\u00a034147/06, \u00a7 40, 21 September 2010; and, more recently, Annen v.\u00a0Germany, no. 3690/10, \u00a7 54, 26 November 2015). For Article 8 to come into play, an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life\u201d (see Axel Springer AG v. Germany, no.\u00a039954/08, \u00a7 83, 7\u00a0February 2012). The Court further reiterates that, for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the person suing in defamation is a requisite element. Mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a publication as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person in question was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant, or that he was targeted by the criticism (see Reznik v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4977/05, \u00a7 45, 4 April 2013, and the authorities cited therein)."

RUSSIA; \u00a7 42: In this connection, the Court reiterates that the right to protection of one\u2019s reputation is covered by Article 8 of the Convention as part of the right to respect for private life (see Chauvy and Others v. France, no.\u00a064915/01, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 2004-VI; Pfeifer v. Austria, no. 12556/03, \u00a7 35, 15\u00a0November 2007; Polanco Torres and Movilla Polanco v. Spain, no.\u00a034147/06, \u00a7 40, 21 September 2010; and, more recently, Annen v.\u00a0Germany, no. 3690/10, \u00a7 54, 26 November 2015). For Article 8 to come into play, an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life\u201d (see Axel Springer AG v. Germany, no.\u00a039954/08, \u00a7 83, 7\u00a0February 2012). The Court further reiterates that, for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the person suing in defamation is a requisite element. Mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a publication as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person in question was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant, or that he was targeted by the criticism (see Reznik v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4977/05, \u00a7 45, 4 April 2013, and the authorities cited therein)."

    "question": "Under what circumstances can a person be presumed dead based on the passage of time since their detention, and is a finding of state involvement necessary for this presumption to be made?",
    "answer": "Whether the failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee\u2019s fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on concrete elements, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, 2000, \u00a7 82). It must be accepted that the more time goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died. The passage of time may therefore to some extent affect the weight to be attached to other elements of circumstantial evidence before it can be concluded that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. However, this presumption of death is not automatic and is only reached on examination of the circumstances of the case, in which the lapse of time since the person was seen alive or heard from is a relevant element (Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], 2009, \u00a7 143; Aslakhanova and Others v. Russia, 2012, \u00a7 100). Moreover, a finding of State involvement in the disappearance of a person is not a condition sine qua non for the purposes of establishing whether that person can be presumed dead; in certain circumstances the disappearance of a person may in itself be considered as life-threatening (Medova v. Russia, 2009, \u00a7 90). Once the Court considers that it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that the disappeared person must be presumed dead following his or her unacknowledged detention by State agents, the responsibility of the State is engaged.",

    "question": "How does the Court define the criteria for applying rights under the Convention, and why is it important to ensure the applicability of the Convention throughout the entire territory of a State, without selective restrictions?",
    "answer": "Whenever the State, through its agents, exercises control and authority, and thus jurisdiction, over an individual, the State is under an obligation under Article 1 to secure to that individual the rights and freedoms under Section I of the Convention that are relevant to the situation of that individual. The Convention precludes territorial exclusions other than in the instance referred to in Article 56 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (dependent territories) (ibid., \u00a7 140; N.D. and N.T. v. Spain [GC], 2020, \u00a7 106; and A.A. and Others v. North Macedonia, 2022, \u00a7 61). In other words, the territorial scope of the Convention cannot be reduced, selectively and artificially, to only certain parts of the territory of a Contracting State (ibid., 2022, \u00a7 63). Indeed, for reasons of legal policy \u2013 the need to maintain equality between the States Parties and to ensure the effectiveness of the Convention \u2013 it could not be otherwise. But for the presumption, the applicability of the Convention could be selectively restricted to only parts of the territory of certain States Parties, thus rendering the notion of effective human rights protection underpinning the entire Convention meaningless while, at the same time, allowing discrimination between the States Parties, that is to say between those which accepted the application of the Convention over the whole of their territory and those which did not (Assanidze v. Georgia, 2004, \u00a7\u00a7 141-142). Moreover, the practical difficulties in the migration context cannot justify leaving an area outside the law where individuals are covered by no legal system capable of affording them enjoyment of the rights and guarantees protected by the Convention which the States have undertaken to secure (A.A. and Others v. North Macedonia, 2022, \u00a7 63). The Convention is a constitutional instrument of European public order.",

There were previously seven Ukrainian-language schools in Crimea, and 500 schools in which at least some classes were available in the Ukrainian language. There were also numerous public schools in which it was possible for Tatar students to study in their own language. During 2014, however, this educational plurality was heavily suppressed (though no details as to those specifically responsible were provided), depriving ethnic Ukrainians and Tatars of the possibility of receiving education in their native tongue. As stated in paragraph 238 of the Report on the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights of 15 November 2014, by the end of the year there were only twenty secondary schools in which it was possible to receive any form of education in Ukrainian (see paragraph 238 of the Report mentioned in paragraph 29 (xvi) above). b. Children and their parents have been persecuted for speaking Ukrainian or demonstrating an apparently \u201cpro-Ukrainian\u201d position. Witnesses report FSB officers visiting schools and requesting the teachers to provide the names of children who speak Ukrainian in public. Parents have then been warned by the authorities of the risk of prosecution \u201cfor separatism\u201d. c. On 30 December 2014 the Crimean authorities issued \u201cDecree No. 651\u201d to approve a \u201cState Programme for Development of Education and Science in the Republic of Crimea for 2015-2017\u201d. The programme does not envisage access to education in a native language. d. In 2015 the \u201cMinistry of Education, Science and Youth of Crimea\u201d ordered the administrations of educational establishments to conduct an audit of literature available in libraries and educational premises to determine whether collections included banned items on the Russian Federal List of Extremist Literature (see paragraph 29 (xix) above). Literature with Islamic or Tatar content has been seized and destroyed."

The Court\u2019s obligation, in this respect, is to have regard to the special character of the Convention as a constitutional instrument of European public order for the protection of individual human beings and its role, as set out in Article 19 of the Convention, is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties (the above-cited Loizidou judgment ( preliminary objections ), at \u00a7 93). It is therefore difficult to contend that a failure to accept the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the respondent States would fall foul of the Convention\u2019s ordre public objective, which itself underlines the essentially regional vocation of the Convention system, or of Article 19 of the Convention which does not shed any particular light on the territorial ambit of that system. It is true that, in its above-cited Cyprus v. Turkey judgment (at \u00a7 78), the Court was conscious of the need to avoid \u201ca regrettable vacuum in the system of human-rights protection\u201d in northern Cyprus. However, and as noted by the Governments, that comment related to an entirely different situation to the present: the inhabitants of northern Cyprus would have found themselves excluded from the benefits of the Convention safeguards and system which they had previously enjoyed, by Turkey\u2019s \u201ceffective control\u201d of the territory and by the accompanying inability of the Cypriot Government, as a Contracting State, to fulfil the obligations it had undertaken under the Convention. In short, the Convention is a multi-lateral treaty operating, subject to Article 56 of the Convention , in an essentially regional context and notably in the legal space ( espace juridique ) of the Contracting States. The FRY clearly does not fall within this legal space. The Convention was not designed to be applied throughout the world, even in respect of the conduct of Contracting States. Accordingly, the desirability of avoiding a gap or vacuum in human rights\u2019 protection has so far been relied on by the Court in favour of establishing jurisdiction only when the territory in question was one that, but for the specific circumstances, would normally be covered by the Convention."

The system of protection as it now operates has, in that regard, been modified by Protocol No. 11, so that the right of individual application is no longer dependent on a declaration by the Contracting States.

However, and as noted by the Governments, that comment related to an entirely different situation to the present: the inhabitants of northern Cyprus would have found themselves excluded from the benefits of the Convention safeguards and system which they had previously enjoyed, by Turkey\u2019s \u201ceffective control\u201d of the territory and by the accompanying inability of the Cypriot Government, as a Contracting State, to fulfil the obligations it had undertaken under the Convention. In short, the Convention is a multi-lateral treaty operating, subject to Article 56 of the Convention , in an essentially regional context and notably in the legal space ( espace juridique ) of the Contracting States. The FRY clearly does not fall within this legal space. The Convention was not designed to be applied throughout the world, even in respect of the conduct of Contracting States. Accordingly, the desirability of avoiding a gap or vacuum in human rights\u2019 protection has so far been relied on by the Court in favour of establishing jurisdiction only when the territory in question was one that, but for the specific circumstances, would normally be covered by the Convention."

    "answer": "The Court thus found a violation of Article 13 in the light of Article 5. However, where the Court has found a violation of Article 5 on procedural aspects, it may conclude that it does not need to examine the complaint separately under Article 13, even though it is closely related to the Article 5 complaint and must therefore be declared admissible (Bazorkina v. Russia, 2006, \u00a7 165; Imakayeva v. Russia, 2006, \u00a7 197). The Court takes the view that Article 5 contains a certain number of procedural safeguards related to the lawfulness of detention. Where the relatives of a person have an arguable claim that the latter has disappeared at the hands of the authorities, the notion of an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the relatives to the investigatory procedure (Kurt v. Turkey, 1998, \u00a7 140).",

In the view of the Court, where the relatives of a person have an arguable claim that the latter has disappeared at the hands of the authorities, the notion of an effective remedy for the purposes of Article\u00a013 entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the relatives to the investigatory procedure (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Aksoy, Ayd\u0131n and Kaya judgments at p.\u00a02287, \u00a7 98, pp. 1895\u201396, \u00a7 103 and pp. 329\u201331, \u00a7\u00a7 106 and 107, respectively).

The Court will first consider the arguments of the applicants, supported by the third parties, regarding the domestic legal framework as such. The criticism was made that section 160 does not require local authorities to make their own assessment of the proportionality, in terms of Article 8, of the measures sought when they apply to the courts under this provision. However, as the domestic courts have clearly stated, an application is merely a vehicle to bring a complaint before the courts; it does not in itself determine rights or liabilities. It falls to the competent domestic court to examine whether there has been a breach of the planning laws and then, having regard to the non-exhaustive list of considerations identified in domestic law, to decide whether or not to exercise its discretion to grant orders (see paragraphs 51 and 55 above). The decision to grant or refuse relief is a judicial function and the courts are under a general obligation, by virtue of Section 2 of the 2003 Act, to interpret domestic law, insofar as is possible, in accordance with the Convention (see paragraph 42 above). A person at risk of losing their home on account of proceedings brought under this statutory provision must be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined judicially, in keeping with the requirements of Article 8. Accordingly, the Court does not consider this specific criticism to be justified."

It is true that all requests for the applicant\u2019s release lodged with the courts were considered speedily. The Court notes, however, that on 27\u00a0May\u00a02002 the applicant\u2019s lawyer provided a number of arguments in support of the applicant\u2019s release (see paragraph 12 above), in particular that the applicant was a minor; had no previous convictions; could not obstruct the collection of evidence or destroy it; had positive aspects to his character; permanently resided in Kerch; did not \u2013 and could not \u2013 try to abscond due to lack of resources or relatives in other parts of the country; and that there was no indication that he would reoffend if released.

However, although the relevant domestic courts ordered the prolongation of the first applicant\u2019s detention at the end of each hearing, there is no evidence in the case file to suggest that the issue of the lawfulness of his initial or continuing detention was subjected to a meaningful examination, which would have required an assessment of the compliance of the detention with domestic procedural requirements, as well as a review of the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the arrest and the ensuing detention (see J\u0117\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000IX). Not even when it delivered its judgment against the first applicant did the Famagusta Assize Court explain why it had disregarded his allegations of abduction. It simply dismissed his arguments by stating that they were \u201cnot credible\u201d, without giving any further explanation. In those circumstances, the Court is of the view that the challenges made by the first applicant against the lawfulness of his detention within the domestic criminal proceedings proved ineffective in the instant case. Moreover, contrary to the Government\u2019s allegation, the fact that he did not explicitly invoke Article 5 of the Convention during those proceedings cannot be held against him, as he raised the substance of his Article\u00a05 complaints before the relevant courts (see Castells v.

The Court will first consider the arguments of the applicants, supported by the third parties, regarding the domestic legal framework as such. The criticism was made that section 160 does not require local authorities to make their own assessment of the proportionality, in terms of Article 8, of the measures sought when they apply to the courts under this provision. However, as the domestic courts have clearly stated, an application is merely a vehicle to bring a complaint before the courts; it does not in itself determine rights or liabilities. It falls to the competent domestic court to examine whether there has been a breach of the planning laws and then, having regard to the non-exhaustive list of considerations identified in domestic law, to decide whether or not to exercise its discretion to grant orders (see paragraphs 51 and 55 above). The decision to grant or refuse relief is a judicial function and the courts are under a general obligation, by virtue of Section 2 of the 2003 Act, to interpret domestic law, insofar as is possible, in accordance with the Convention (see paragraph 42 above). A person at risk of losing their home on account of proceedings brought under this statutory provision must be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined judicially, in keeping with the requirements of Article 8. Accordingly, the Court does not consider this specific criticism to be justified."

However, although the relevant domestic courts ordered the prolongation of the first applicant\u2019s detention at the end of each hearing, there is no evidence in the case file to suggest that the issue of the lawfulness of his initial or continuing detention was subjected to a meaningful examination, which would have required an assessment of the compliance of the detention with domestic procedural requirements, as well as a review of the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the arrest and the ensuing detention (see J\u0117\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000IX).

It simply dismissed his arguments by stating that they were \u201cnot credible\u201d, without giving any further explanation. In those circumstances, the Court is of the view that the challenges made by the first applicant against the lawfulness of his detention within the domestic criminal proceedings proved ineffective in the instant case. Moreover, contrary to the Government\u2019s allegation, the fact that he did not explicitly invoke Article 5 of the Convention during those proceedings cannot be held against him, as he raised the substance of his Article\u00a05 complaints before the relevant courts (see Castells v.

UKRAINE; \u00a7 100: As to the right to review of the lawfulness of the detention guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4, the Court notes that in this and other similar cases previously decided it faced an issue of the domestic courts' failure to provide an adequate response to the applicants' arguments as to the necessity of their release. Despite the existence of the domestic judicial authorities competent to examine such cases and to order release, it appears that without a clear procedure for review of the lawfulness of the detention the above authorities often remain a theoretical rather than practical remedy for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Molodorych v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0108, not final). Moreover, speediness of review of the lawfulness of the detention seems to be compromised by the fact that such a review is linked to other procedural steps in the criminal case against the applicant during the investigation and trial, while such procedural steps might not necessarily coincide with the need to decide on the applicant's further detention promptly and with reasonable intervals (see, among many other authorities, Svershov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-72, and Sergey Volosyuk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05259). Finally, the current legislation does not protect the applicants from arbitrariness, when, like in Yeloyev case, the domestic court refused to look again into the reasonableness of the applicant's detention on the ground that it had ruled on the lawfulness of his detention on several previous occasions, therefore denying the applicant's right to a review of the lawfulness of his detention as guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Yeloyev v.\u00a0Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7 65). The Court considers that these issues should be addressed by the domestic authorities, to avoid further repetitive complaints under this head."

What is crucial is whether, following a concrete assessment of the specific acts, the application of one criminal law rather than the other has put the defendant at a disadvantage as concerns the sentencing (see Maktouf and Damjanovic, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a069-70).",
          "86": "86.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes at this juncture that, while the applicant\u2019s case is in some respects similar to the case of Maktouf and Damjanovi\u0107 (cited above), in so far as in both cases the courts (i) had established the more lenient criminal law in the context of two competing laws \u2013 that which was in force at the time when the acts were committed and that which entered into force before the applicants were convicted \u2013 by taking into account the specific circumstances in which the particular offences was committed and (ii) had imposed prison sentences which were close to the statutory limits provided for by the relevant legislation, the two cases also present notable differences. In particular, unlike in the case of Maktouf and Damjanovi\u0107, in the applicant\u2019s case the domestic courts took into account in their assessment of the more lenient criminal law not only the statutory maximum and minimum prison sentence that could have been imposed on the applicant, but also the possibility provided for by the new law to impose a fine and the manner in which a sentence was to be served under both the new and the old law \u2013 more specifically, whether the serving of the sentence could be suspended or the imposition of a penalty postponed. The above elements had a bearing on the applicant\u2019s effective right to drive a car. This right was considered of paramount importance by him, given that his earning a living depended on this (see paragraph 27 above).",
          "87": "87.\u00a0\u00a0In this context, the Court notes that in the applicant\u2019s case the definition of the offence concerning the driving of a vehicle on a public road under the influence of alcohol is practically the same in the old criminal law, which was applicable at the time the offence was committed, as in the new criminal legislation, which came into force prior to the applicant\u2019s conviction and which he viewed to be the more lenient criminal law in his case. Moreover, the applicant did not dispute that his actions had constituted a criminal offence defined with sufficient accessibility and foreseeability at the time when it had been committed. The lawfulness of his conviction is therefore not an issue in the instant case.",
          "88": "88.\u00a0\u00a0However, the two criminal laws provide for different sentencing frameworks regarding driving a vehicle on a public road under the influence of alcohol. Under the old criminal law, driving a vehicle under the influence was punishable by imprisonment for a term of one to five years. The courts could suspend the serving of a sentence for the duration of a supervision period if several conditions were met. One or more conditions could also be imposed by the court during the supervision period, including a ban on driving a vehicle. Moreover, the penalty had to be reduced by a third in cases examined under a summary procedure.",
          "89": "89.\u00a0\u00a0Under the new criminal law, driving a vehicle on a public road under the influence of alcohol attracts imprisonment for a term of one to five years or a fine. The courts may waive or postpone the imposition of a penalty, or suspend the serving of a sentence for the duration of a supervision period if several conditions are met. One or more conditions may also be imposed by the court during the supervision period. Where the court decides to postpone the imposition of a penalty, one of the conditions which may be imposed on a person found guilty of an offence during the supervision period includes a ban on driving certain vehicles. Moreover, the penalty has to be reduced by a third in cases examined under a summary procedure where the penalty is imprisonment.",
          "90": "90.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that an overall comparison of the punitive regime under each of the criminal laws applicable to the applicant shows that the only presumed penalty which could be imposed in his case under the old criminal law was imprisonment for a term of one to five years. By contrast, under the new criminal law the domestic courts could choose between imprisonment for a term of one to five years and a fine. Moreover, even though both criminal laws provided, subject to certain conditions, that the sentence imposed on the alleged offender could be suspended and/or reduced, only the new criminal law provided that the imposition of the sentence could be waived or postponed.",
          "91": "91.\u00a0\u00a0The Court further notes that a long or maximum prison sentence is subject to a more stringent regime under the new criminal law than under the old law because, under the new criminal law, any prison sentence over three years has to be served.",
          "92": "92.\u00a0\u00a0In these circumstances, the Court will examine whether the specific assessment made by the last-instance court in the applicant\u2019s case, which led to the application of the old criminal law, could reasonably be considered the most favourable for him in terms of sentencing.",
          "93": "93.\u00a0\u00a0The Court observes in this regard that the last-instance court considered the general sentencing criteria set out in both the new and old criminal law and applied them to the particular circumstances in which the applicant had committed the offence. It accepted the prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s arguments that the offence committed by him was serious and pointed out that the sentence imposed on him by the first-instance court had not been appropriate to ensure his rehabilitation. It then sentenced the applicant to the maximum sentence provided for by the old criminal law, namely three years and four months\u2019 imprisonment. Had the new criminal law been applied, the maximum prison sentence imposed on the applicant would have been the same.",
          "94": "94.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that the applicant argued that the new criminal law had been more lenient for him than the old criminal law, given that under the newer provision the courts had had the option to sentence him to a fine. The Court also notes, however, that none of the courts which examined his case took the view that a fine could be imposed in his case given the particular circumstances of the incident he was involved in. In so far as his argument may be understood to amount to a general complaint about the severity of the penalty imposed on him by the last-instance court, the Court reiterates that issues relating to the appropriateness of a penalty do not fall within the scope of Article 7, as it is not the Court\u2019s role to decide the length of a prison sentence or the type of penalty which is suited to any given offence (see Hummatov v. Azerbaijan (dec.), nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, 18\u00a0May 2006; Hakkar v. France (dec.), no. 43580/04, 7 April 2009; and Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09 and 2 others, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).",
          "95": "95.\u00a0\u00a0What is important for the Court is whether there was a real possibility that the applicant could have received a more favourable sentence had the new criminal law been applied in his case. As already observed above (see paragraph 93) the last-instance court did not consider the offence minor and sentenced him to the maximum prison sentence, which was over three\u00a0years. The Court notes at this point that the new criminal law requires that the offence under examination be minor or that the prison sentences set for or imposed on defendants be three years or less for the various manners in which a sentence is to be served to take effect and to be applicable in any given case. Since in the applicant\u2019s case the offence committed by him and the prison sentence imposed on him did not meet these requirements, he would have been forced to serve his prison sentence had the new criminal law been applied.",
          "96": "96.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the Court finds nothing to support the applicant\u2019s allegation that the last-instance court applied the more stringent criminal law in his case. On the contrary, since there was no obvious possibility that the application of the new criminal law would have operated to his advantage as concerns sentencing, it cannot be said that he was not afforded effective safeguards against the imposition of a heavier penalty.",
          "97": "97.\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s conclusion is not affected by the fact that when the last-instance court reduced the applicant\u2019s prison sentence by a third, it referred to the new criminal procedure rules concerning the length of the sentence to be imposed when a case had been dealt with under a simplified procedure (see paragraph 34 above). Similar provisions were also available under the old criminal law and would have had the same effect as regards the applicant\u2019s sentence. Therefore, the Court considers that the approach of the last-instance court could not be viewed as an unlawful attempt to create a new law (see paragraph 44 above) or that it has produced consequences that are inconsistent with the Convention requirements.",
          "98": "98.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the Court considers that there has been no violation of Article\u00a07 of the Convention in the particular circumstances of the present case."

    "answer": "The principle of legal certainty requires domestic authorities to respect the binding nature of a final judicial decision. However, the requirements of legal certainty are not absolute. In criminal cases, they must be assessed in the light of, for example, Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7, which expressly permits a State to reopen a case due to the emergence of new facts, or where a fundamental defect is detected in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case. Nevertheless, compliance with Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 is not in itself sufficient to establish compliance with the requirements of a fair trial under Article 6 (Nikitin v. Russia, 2004, \u00a7 56). Certain special circumstances of the case may reveal that the actual manner in which the procedure for reopening of a final decision was used impaired the very essence of a fair trial. In particular, the Court has to assess whether, in a given case, the power to launch and conduct such a procedure was exercised by the authorities so as to strike, to the maximum extent possible, a fair balance between the interests of the individual and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the system of criminal justice (ibid., \u00a7 57).",

The Court has emphasised that the requirements of legal certainty are not absolute, in particular in criminal proceedings. In such cases, they must be assessed in the light of, for example, Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7, which expressly permits a State to reopen a case if new facts emerge, or where a fundamental defect which could have affected the outcome of the case is detected in previous proceedings (see Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a055 and 56). The possibility of re-examining or reopening cases has also been considered by the Committee of Ministers as a means of achieving restitutio in integrum, particularly in the context of the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments. In its Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at the domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, it encouraged the Contracting Parties to review their domestic legal systems with a view to ensuring that adequate opportunity for the re-examination of a case, including reopening of proceedings, exists in instances where the Court has found a violation of the Convention."

Accordingly, the Court has held that the mere possibility of reopening a criminal case is prima facie compatible with the Convention (see Nikitin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 50178/99, \u00a7\u00a7 55-57, ECHR 2004VIII). However, it has emphasised that higher courts\u2019 power of review should only be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, and not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Bujni\u0163a v. Moldova, no. 36492/02, \u00a7 20, 16 January 2007, and Bota v.\u00a0Romania, no. 16382/03, \u00a7\u00a7 33 and 34, 4 November 2008)."

    "question": "In the context of criminal proceedings, if a person charged with a criminal offence is excluded from the proceedings where their guilt is determined, how does the principle of an oral and public hearing, and the specific rights under Article 6, such as the right to \"defend himself in person\" and \"to examine or have examined witnesses\", apply?",
    "answer": "The principle of an oral and public hearing is particularly important in the criminal context, where a person charged with a criminal offence must generally be able to attend a hearing at first instance (Jussila v. Finland [GC], 2006, \u00a7 40; Tierce and Others v. San Marino, 2000, \u00a7 94; Igor Pascari v. the Republic of Moldova, 2016, \u00a7 27, concerning the applicant\u2019s exclusion from the proceedings in which his guilt for a road traffic accident had been determined). Without being present, it is difficult to see how that person could exercise the specific rights set out in sub-paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of paragraph 3 of Article 6, namely the right to \u201cdefend himself in person\u201d, \u201cto examine or have examined witnesses\u201d and \u201cto have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court\u201d. The duty to guarantee the right of a criminal defendant to be present in the courtroom ranks therefore as one of the essential requirements of Article 6 (Hermi v. Italy [GC], 2006, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59; Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], 2006, \u00a7\u00a7 81 and 84; Arps v. Croatia, 2016, \u00a7 28).",

It further notes that it is clear from the case file that the Bender Court of Appeal determined, inter alia, that the applicant was responsible for causing the accident of 14 August 2009. Although that finding did not amount to a final determination of his guilt, it had a decisive effect on such a determination. Indeed, the police based its decision of 22 January 2010 entirely on the conclusions reached by the Bender District Court of 19 November 2009 without making any further investigation or reaching any new conclusions of its own (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). In fact, the chief inspector was obliged to conform to the to the appeal court\u2019s judgment and could not have reached any other conclusion. Moreover, the judgment of 19\u00a0November 2009 had the effect of res judicata in respect of both the applicant and P.C., if only for making the latter immune from responsibility for the accident. Since in a car accident involving two vehicles, there should be at least one person responsible, the final exclusion of P.C.\u2019s responsibility by the Bender Court of Appeal implicitly predetermined the applicant\u2019s guilt. In those circumstances, the Court must conclude that there has been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention."

    "answer": "In the context of implementing facial recognition technology, the Court emphasised that, for the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirement to be met, it was essential to have detailed rules governing the scope and application of measures as well as strong safeguards against the risk of abuse and arbitrariness. The need for safeguards will be all the greater where the use of live facial recognition technology is concerned (Glukhin v. Russia, 2023, \u00a7 82). In this case, where the Court for the first time addressed the issue of the use of such technology, it expressed strong doubts that the domestic legal provisions which authorised the processing of biometric personal data, including with the aid of facial recognition technology, \u201cin connection with the administration of justice\u201d met the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirement, since they were widely formulated and would appear to allow processing of such data in connection with any type of judicial proceedings. Domestic law did not contain any limitations on the nature of situations which might give rise to the use of facial recognition technology, the intended purposes, the categories of person who might be targeted, or on the processing of sensitive personal data. Moreover, there would appear to be no procedural safeguards accompanying the use of facial recognition technology, such as authorisation procedures, procedures to be followed for examining, using and storing the data obtained, supervisory control mechanisms or available remedies (ibid., \u00a7 83).",

This legal provision is widely formulated. Taking into account that the Government did not refer to any authoritative interpretation of that provision by the Supreme or Constitutional Courts or submit any examples of its restrictive interpretation and application in administrative and judicial practice, it appears that it allows processing of biometric personal data \u2013 including with the aid of facial recognition technology \u2013 in connection with any judicial proceedings. The domestic law does not contain any limitations on the nature of situations which may give rise to the use of facial recognition technology, the intended purposes, the categories of people who may be targeted, or on processing of sensitive personal data. Furthermore, the Government did not refer to any procedural safeguards accompanying the use of facial recognition technology in Russia, such as the authorisation procedures, the procedures to be followed for examining, using and storing the data obtained, supervisory control mechanisms and available remedies."

                "paragraph_text": "CASE OF GLUKHIN v. RUSSIA; \u00a7 39: . Guidelines 05/2022 on the use of facial recognition technology in the area of law enforcement of 26 April 2023 by the European Data Protection Board provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201c36. The processing of biometric data under all circumstances constitutes a serious interference in itself. This does not depend on the outcome, e.g. a positive matching. The processing constitutes an interference even if the biometric template is immediately deleted after the matching against a police database results in a no-hit ... 43. Article 52(1) of the Charter sets the requirement of a specific legal basis. This legal basis must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication of the conditions and circumstances in which authorities are empowered to resort to any measures of collection of data and secret surveillance. It must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities so as to ensure individuals the minimum degree of protection as entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society. Moreover, lawfulness requires adequate safeguards to ensure that in particular an individual\u2019s right under Article 8 of the Charter is respected. These principles also apply to the processing of personal data for purposes of evaluating, training and further developing of FRT systems. 44. Given that biometric data when processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person constitute special categories of data listed in Article 10 LED, the different applications of FRT in most cases would require a dedicated law precisely describing the application and the conditions for its use. This encompasses in particular the types of crime and, where applicable, the appropriate threshold of severity of these crimes, in order to, among other things, effectively exclude petty crime ... 51. According to the CJEU\u2019s settled case-law, derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. This also implies that there are no less intrusive means available to achieve the purpose. Possible alternatives such as \u2013 depending on the given purpose \u2013 additional staffing, more frequent policing or additional street lighting have to be carefully identified and assessed. Legislative measures should differentiate and target those persons covered by it in the light of the objective, e.g. fighting serious crime. If it covers all persons in a general manner without such differentiation, limitation or exception, it intensifies the interference. It also intensifies the interference if the data processing covers a significant part of the population. 52. The protection of personal data resulting from the explicit obligation laid down in Article 8(1) of the Charter is especially important for the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter. Legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and impose safeguards so that the persons whose data have been processed have sufficient guarantees to effectively protect their personal data against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access or use of that data. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subject to automatic processing and where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to the data. Furthermore, internal or external, e.g. judicial, authorisation of the deployment of FRT may also contribute as safeguards, and may prove to be necessary in certain cases of severe interference. 53. The rules laid down have to be adapted to the specific situation, e.g. the quantity of data processed, the nature of the data and the risk of unlawful access to the data. This calls for rules which would serve, in particular, to govern the protection and security of the data in question in a clear and strict manner in order to ensure their full integrity and confidentiality. 54. With regard to the relationship between the controller and the processor it should not be permitted for the processors to have regard only to economic considerations when determining the level of security which they apply to personal data; this could endanger a sufficient high level of protection. 55. An act of law has to lay down substantive and procedural conditions and objective criteria by which to determine the limits of competent authorities\u2019 access to data and their subsequent use. For the purposes of prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions, the offences concerned would have to be considered sufficiently serious to justify the extent and seriousness of these interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined for example in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. 56. The data has to be processed in a way that ensures the applicability and effect of the EU data protection rules; in particular those provided by Article 8 of the Charter, which states that the compliance with the requirements of protection and security shall be subject to control by an independent authority. The geographical place where the processing takes place may in such a situation be relevant. 57. With regard to the different steps of processing of personal data, a distinction should be made between the categories of data on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned. The determination of the conditions of the processing, for example, the determination of the retention period, must be based on objective criteria in order to ensure that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. 58. Based on each situation, the assessment of necessity and proportionality has to identify and consider all implications that fall within the scope of other fundamental rights, such as human dignity under Article 1 of the Charter, freedom of thought, conscience and religion under Article 10 of the Charter, freedom of expression under Article 11 of the Charter as well as freedom of assembly and association under Article 12 of the Charter. 59. Furthermore, it has to be considered as a matter of severity, that if the data is systematically processed without the knowledge of the data subjects, it is likely to generate a general conception of constant surveillance. This may lead to chilling effects in regard of some or all of the fundamental rights concerned ... 73. Processing can only be regarded as \"strictly necessary\" if the interference to the protection of personal data and its restrictions is limited to what is absolutely necessary. The addition of the term \u201cstrictly\u201d means that the legislator intended the processing of special categories of data to only take place under conditions even stricter than the conditions for necessity. This requirement should be interpreted as being indispensable. It restricts the margin of appreciation permitted to the law enforcement authority in the necessity test to an absolute minimum. In accordance with the settled case-law of the CJEU, the condition of \u201cstrict necessity\u201d is also closely linked to the requirement of objective criteria in order to define the circumstances and conditions under which processing can be undertaken, thus excluding any processing of a general or systematic nature ... 104. The use of facial recognition technologies is intrinsically linked to processing of significant amounts of personal data, including special categories of data. The face and, more generally, biometric data are permanently and irrevocably linked to a person\u2019s identity. Therefore, the use of facial recognition has direct or indirect impact on a number of fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights that may go beyond privacy and data protection, such as human dignity, freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, and others. This is particularly relevant in the area of law enforcement and criminal justice. 105. The EDPB understands the need for law enforcement authorities to benefit from the best possible tools to quickly identify the perpetrators of terrorist acts and other serious crimes. However, such tools should be used in strict compliance with the applicable legal framework and only in cases when they satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality, as laid down in Article 52(1) of the Charter. Moreover, while modern technologies may be part of the solution, they are by no means a \u2018silver bullet\u2019. 106. There are certain use cases of facial recognition technologies, which pose unacceptably high risks to individuals and society (\u2018red lines\u2019). For these reasons the EDPB and the EDPS have called for their general ban. 107. In particular, remote biometric identification of individuals in publicly accessible spaces poses a high risk of intrusion into individuals\u2019 private lives and does not have a place in a democratic society, as by its nature, it entails mass surveillance. In the same vein, the EDPB considers AI-supported facial recognition systems categorising individuals based on their biometrics into clusters according to ethnicity, gender, as well as political or sexual orientation as not compatible with the Charter. Furthermore, the EDPB is convinced that the use of facial recognition or similar technologies, to infer emotions of a natural person is highly undesirable and should be prohibited, possibly with few duly justified exceptions. In addition, the EDPB considers that processing of personal data in a law enforcement context that would rely on a database populated by collection of personal data on a mass-scale and in an indiscriminate way, e.g. by \"scraping\" photographs and facial pictures accessible online, in particular those made available via social networks, would, as such, not meet the strict necessity requirement provided for by Union law.\u201d OTHER RELEVANT MATERIAL"

Guidelines 05/2022 on the use of facial recognition technology in the area of law enforcement of 26 April 2023 by the European Data Protection Board provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201c36. The processing of biometric data under all circumstances constitutes a serious interference in itself. This does not depend on the outcome, e.g. a positive matching. The processing constitutes an interference even if the biometric template is immediately deleted after the matching against a police database results in a no-hit ... 43. Article 52(1) of the Charter sets the requirement of a specific legal basis. This legal basis must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication of the conditions and circumstances in which authorities are empowered to resort to any measures of collection of data and secret surveillance. It must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities so as to ensure individuals the minimum degree of protection as entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society. Moreover, lawfulness requires adequate safeguards to ensure that in particular an individual\u2019s right under Article 8 of the Charter is respected. These principles also apply to the processing of personal data for purposes of evaluating, training and further developing of FRT systems. 44. Given that biometric data when processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person constitute special categories of data listed in Article 10 LED, the different applications of FRT in most cases would require a dedicated law precisely describing the application and the conditions for its use. This encompasses in particular the types of crime and, where applicable, the appropriate threshold of severity of these crimes, in order to, among other things, effectively exclude petty crime ... 51. According to the CJEU\u2019s settled case-law, derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. This also implies that there are no less intrusive means available to achieve the purpose. Possible alternatives such as \u2013 depending on the given purpose \u2013 additional staffing, more frequent policing or additional street lighting have to be carefully identified and assessed. Legislative measures should differentiate and target those persons covered by it in the light of the objective, e.g. fighting serious crime. If it covers all persons in a general manner without such differentiation, limitation or exception, it intensifies the interference. It also intensifies the interference if the data processing covers a significant part of the population. 52. The protection of personal data resulting from the explicit obligation laid down in Article 8(1) of the Charter is especially important for the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter. Legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and impose safeguards so that the persons whose data have been processed have sufficient guarantees to effectively protect their personal data against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access or use of that data. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subject to automatic processing and where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to the data. Furthermore, internal or external, e.g. judicial, authorisation of the deployment of FRT may also contribute as safeguards, and may prove to be necessary in certain cases of severe interference. 53. The rules laid down have to be adapted to the specific situation, e.g. the quantity of data processed, the nature of the data and the risk of unlawful access to the data. This calls for rules which would serve, in particular, to govern the protection and security of the data in question in a clear and strict manner in order to ensure their full integrity and confidentiality. 54. With regard to the relationship between the controller and the processor it should not be permitted for the processors to have regard only to economic considerations when determining the level of security which they apply to personal data; this could endanger a sufficient high level of protection. 55.

Russia (App. No. 41863/16, Doc 1), the ECtHR stated that Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention requires laws to provide \"adequate and effective protective measures\" against any potential harm to individuals' private life, and laws must be applied and interpreted strictly.\nThis reinforces the \"quality of law\" requirement, which is crucial in determining whether a law has been applied in a manner that is consistent with the purpose of a Convention provision.\nIn the case of Gaughran v. the United Kingdom (App. No. 45245/15, Doc 2), the ECtHR recognized the difficulty of proving the use of facial recognition technology in cases where the domestic legislation does not require official records or the provision of such records to the individual concerned, on request or automatically.\nHowever, the Court has noted instances where the use of facial recognition technology has been inferred from the rapid identification of individuals (see Vasiliyeva v. Russia,).\nHere, the quality of law is questioned, as the absence of a clear record of its use raises concerns about the legal restrictions in place for its application, if any.\nMoreover, the case of Guliyeva v. Russia (App. No. 61828/13, Doc 3) illustrates that although the individual, in this case a minor, was not explicitly identified by name, it was not reasonable for the applicant to assume that her image was processed using facial recognition technology.\nThis assumption was supported by numerous other cases reported in the press.\nIn the case of Article 19 v. Russia (App. No. 32988/09, Doc 4), the ECtHR stressed the importance of clear legal provisions on the use of live facial recognition technologies and the potential risks to fundamental rights and freedoms.\nSimilarly, in Guidelines on Facial Recognition (2021) by the Consultative Committee of the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data (ETS 108) (Doc 9), it is recommended to ensure that the development and use of facial recognition technologies respect the rights to privacy and protection of personal data by strengthening human rights and fundamental freedoms through implementing the principles enshrined in the Convention.\nIn the case of an unspecified applicant v. Russia (App. No. 62574/13, Doc 7), the ECtHR highlighted the importance of strict necessity and proportionality tests being applied when creating databases (watch lists) for specific, legitimate, and explicit law enforcement purposes.\nWhile specific data protection laws are not applicable in Russia in all cases, as stated in the case of Guliyeva v. Russia (see paras 50-51, Doc 3), the ECtHR still emphasizes the need for compliance with the \"quality of law\" requirement to ensure the protection of individuals' privacy rights under Article 8 of the Convention.\nIn summary, the European Court of Human Rights assesses the compliance of domestic measures authorizing the processing of biometric personal data, including facial recognition technology, with the \"quality of law\" requirement under Article 8 of the Convention by examining the strictness and transparency of the legal framework and ensuring strong safeguards for individuals' privacy rights.",

The Court finds it to be beyond dispute that the fight against crime, and in particular against organised crime and terrorism, which is one of the challenges faced by today\u2019s European societies, depends to a great extent on the use of modern scientific techniques of investigation and identification. However, while it recognises the importance of such techniques in the detection and investigation of crime, the Court must delimit the scope of its examination. The question is not whether the processing of biometric personal data by facial recognition technology may in general be regarded as justified under the Convention. The only issue to be considered by the Court is whether the processing of the applicant\u2019s personal data was justified under Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention in the present case (compare S. and Marper , cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 105-06)."

                "paragraph_text": "CASE OF GLUKHIN v. RUSSIA; \u00a7 39: . Guidelines 05/2022 on the use of facial recognition technology in the area of law enforcement of 26 April 2023 by the European Data Protection Board provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201c36. The processing of biometric data under all circumstances constitutes a serious interference in itself. This does not depend on the outcome, e.g. a positive matching. The processing constitutes an interference even if the biometric template is immediately deleted after the matching against a police database results in a no-hit ... 43. Article 52(1) of the Charter sets the requirement of a specific legal basis. This legal basis must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication of the conditions and circumstances in which authorities are empowered to resort to any measures of collection of data and secret surveillance. It must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities so as to ensure individuals the minimum degree of protection as entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society. Moreover, lawfulness requires adequate safeguards to ensure that in particular an individual\u2019s right under Article 8 of the Charter is respected. These principles also apply to the processing of personal data for purposes of evaluating, training and further developing of FRT systems. 44. Given that biometric data when processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person constitute special categories of data listed in Article 10 LED, the different applications of FRT in most cases would require a dedicated law precisely describing the application and the conditions for its use. This encompasses in particular the types of crime and, where applicable, the appropriate threshold of severity of these crimes, in order to, among other things, effectively exclude petty crime ... 51. According to the CJEU\u2019s settled case-law, derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. This also implies that there are no less intrusive means available to achieve the purpose. Possible alternatives such as \u2013 depending on the given purpose \u2013 additional staffing, more frequent policing or additional street lighting have to be carefully identified and assessed. Legislative measures should differentiate and target those persons covered by it in the light of the objective, e.g. fighting serious crime. If it covers all persons in a general manner without such differentiation, limitation or exception, it intensifies the interference. It also intensifies the interference if the data processing covers a significant part of the population. 52. The protection of personal data resulting from the explicit obligation laid down in Article 8(1) of the Charter is especially important for the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter. Legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and impose safeguards so that the persons whose data have been processed have sufficient guarantees to effectively protect their personal data against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access or use of that data. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subject to automatic processing and where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to the data. Furthermore, internal or external, e.g. judicial, authorisation of the deployment of FRT may also contribute as safeguards, and may prove to be necessary in certain cases of severe interference. 53. The rules laid down have to be adapted to the specific situation, e.g. the quantity of data processed, the nature of the data and the risk of unlawful access to the data. This calls for rules which would serve, in particular, to govern the protection and security of the data in question in a clear and strict manner in order to ensure their full integrity and confidentiality. 54. With regard to the relationship between the controller and the processor it should not be permitted for the processors to have regard only to economic considerations when determining the level of security which they apply to personal data; this could endanger a sufficient high level of protection. 55. An act of law has to lay down substantive and procedural conditions and objective criteria by which to determine the limits of competent authorities\u2019 access to data and their subsequent use. For the purposes of prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions, the offences concerned would have to be considered sufficiently serious to justify the extent and seriousness of these interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined for example in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. 56. The data has to be processed in a way that ensures the applicability and effect of the EU data protection rules; in particular those provided by Article 8 of the Charter, which states that the compliance with the requirements of protection and security shall be subject to control by an independent authority. The geographical place where the processing takes place may in such a situation be relevant. 57. With regard to the different steps of processing of personal data, a distinction should be made between the categories of data on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned. The determination of the conditions of the processing, for example, the determination of the retention period, must be based on objective criteria in order to ensure that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. 58. Based on each situation, the assessment of necessity and proportionality has to identify and consider all implications that fall within the scope of other fundamental rights, such as human dignity under Article 1 of the Charter, freedom of thought, conscience and religion under Article 10 of the Charter, freedom of expression under Article 11 of the Charter as well as freedom of assembly and association under Article 12 of the Charter. 59. Furthermore, it has to be considered as a matter of severity, that if the data is systematically processed without the knowledge of the data subjects, it is likely to generate a general conception of constant surveillance. This may lead to chilling effects in regard of some or all of the fundamental rights concerned ... 73. Processing can only be regarded as \"strictly necessary\" if the interference to the protection of personal data and its restrictions is limited to what is absolutely necessary. The addition of the term \u201cstrictly\u201d means that the legislator intended the processing of special categories of data to only take place under conditions even stricter than the conditions for necessity. This requirement should be interpreted as being indispensable. It restricts the margin of appreciation permitted to the law enforcement authority in the necessity test to an absolute minimum. In accordance with the settled case-law of the CJEU, the condition of \u201cstrict necessity\u201d is also closely linked to the requirement of objective criteria in order to define the circumstances and conditions under which processing can be undertaken, thus excluding any processing of a general or systematic nature ... 104. The use of facial recognition technologies is intrinsically linked to processing of significant amounts of personal data, including special categories of data. The face and, more generally, biometric data are permanently and irrevocably linked to a person\u2019s identity. Therefore, the use of facial recognition has direct or indirect impact on a number of fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights that may go beyond privacy and data protection, such as human dignity, freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, and others. This is particularly relevant in the area of law enforcement and criminal justice. 105. The EDPB understands the need for law enforcement authorities to benefit from the best possible tools to quickly identify the perpetrators of terrorist acts and other serious crimes. However, such tools should be used in strict compliance with the applicable legal framework and only in cases when they satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality, as laid down in Article 52(1) of the Charter. Moreover, while modern technologies may be part of the solution, they are by no means a \u2018silver bullet\u2019. 106. There are certain use cases of facial recognition technologies, which pose unacceptably high risks to individuals and society (\u2018red lines\u2019). For these reasons the EDPB and the EDPS have called for their general ban. 107. In particular, remote biometric identification of individuals in publicly accessible spaces poses a high risk of intrusion into individuals\u2019 private lives and does not have a place in a democratic society, as by its nature, it entails mass surveillance. In the same vein, the EDPB considers AI-supported facial recognition systems categorising individuals based on their biometrics into clusters according to ethnicity, gender, as well as political or sexual orientation as not compatible with the Charter. Furthermore, the EDPB is convinced that the use of facial recognition or similar technologies, to infer emotions of a natural person is highly undesirable and should be prohibited, possibly with few duly justified exceptions. In addition, the EDPB considers that processing of personal data in a law enforcement context that would rely on a database populated by collection of personal data on a mass-scale and in an indiscriminate way, e.g. by \"scraping\" photographs and facial pictures accessible online, in particular those made available via social networks, would, as such, not meet the strict necessity requirement provided for by Union law.\u201d OTHER RELEVANT MATERIAL"

The Court has previously found that the storage of photographs by the police, coupled with a possibility of applying facial recognition techniques to them, constituted an interference with the right to private life (see Gaughran v. the United Kingdom , no. 45245/15, \u00a7\u00a7 69-70, 13 February 2020)."

Furthermore, any use of audiovisual recording and facial recognition technology must be subject to robust and well-resourced oversight mechanisms. While part of the oversight can be carried out by independent and impartial data protection authorities, States should consider additional measures, including the involvement of an independent body, preferably of a judicial nature, in charge of authorizing the use of facial recognition technology measures in an assembly context. In any case, any use of recording and facial recognition technology should be open to judicial challenge. In all circumstances, the authorities should be transparent about the use of recording and facial recognition technology and always notify members of the public when they are, or may be, recorded and/or when their images may be processed in a facial recognition system. ... 53. In this context, the High Commissioner recommends that States: ... (h) Never use facial recognition technology to identify those peacefully participating in an assembly; (i) Refrain from recording footage of assembly participants, unless there are concrete indications that participants are engaging in, or will engage in, serious criminal activity, and such recording is provided by law, with the necessary robust safeguards;\u201d COUNCIL OF EUROPE 36 .

The collection of personal data for police purposes should be limited to such as is necessary for the prevention of a real danger or the suppression of a specific criminal offence. Any exception to this provision should be the subject of specific national legislation. ... 2.4. The collection of data on individuals solely on the basis that they have a particular racial origin, particular religious convictions, sexual behaviour or political opinions or belong to particular movements or organisations which are not proscribed by law should be prohibited. The collection of data concerning these factors may only be carried out if absolutely necessary for the purposes of a particular inquiry.\u201d 37 . The Guidelines on Facial Recognition (2021) by the Consultative Committee of the Convention for the protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (ETS 108) provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201cFacial recognition is the automatic processing of digital images containing individuals\u2019 faces for identification or verification of those individuals by using face templates. The sensitivity of information of a biometric nature was recognised explicitly with the inclusion of data uniquely identifying a person under the special categories of data in Article 6 of the modernised Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data (hereinafter \u2018Convention 108+\u2019). The context of the processing of images is relevant to the determination of the sensitive nature of the data, as not all processing of images involves the processing of sensitive data. Images shall only be covered by the definition of biometric data when they are processed through a specific technical means which permits the unique identification or authentication of an individual. These guidelines cover uses of facial recognition technologies, including live facial recognition technologies. ... Integrating facial recognition technologies into existing surveillance systems poses a serious risk to the rights to privacy and protection of personal data, as well as to other fundamental rights, since use of these technologies does not always require the awareness or co-operation of the individuals whose biometric data are processed in this way. This is the case, for instance, with the possibility to access digital images of individuals on the internet. In order to prevent such infringements, the parties to Convention 108+ shall ensure that the development and use of facial recognition respect the rights to privacy and personal data protection, thereby strengthening human rights and fundamental freedoms by implementing the principles enshrined in the Convention in the specific context of facial recognition technologies. ... Lawfulness As provided for by Article 6 of Convention 108+, the processing of special categories of data, such as biometric data, shall only be authorised if such processing relies on an appropriate legal basis, and if complementary and appropriate safeguards are enshrined in domestic law. These safeguards shall be adapted to the risks involved and to the interests, rights and freedoms to be protected. In some legislation, the prohibition of such processing is a rule and its implementation is allowed only by way of exception, in certain specific cases (for example, with the explicit consent of individuals, to protect their vital interests or when the processing is necessary for reasons of overriding public interest), and subject to safeguards that are appropriate to the risks involved. The necessity for the use of facial recognition technologies has to be assessed together with the proportionality to the purpose and the impact on the rights of the data subjects. The different cases of use should be categorised and a legal framework applicable to the processing of biometric data through facial recognition should be in place. This legal framework should address, for each different use, in particular: - a detailed explanation of the specific use and the intended purpose; - the minimum reliability and accuracy of the algorithm used; - the retention duration of the photos used; - the possibility of auditing these criteria; - the traceability of the process; - the safeguards. Strict limitation of certain uses by law The level of intrusiveness of facial recognition and related infringement of the rights to privacy and data protection will vary according to the particular use and there will be cases where domestic law will strictly limit or even completely prohibit its use where that decision has been reached through the democratic process. The use of live facial recognition technologies in uncontrolled environments, in light of its intrusiveness on the right to privacy and the dignity of individuals, coupled with the risk of an adverse impact on other human rights and fundamental freedoms, should be subject to a democratic debate and the possibility of a moratorium pending a full analysis. ... Integrating digital images into facial recognition technologies Legislators and decision makers shall ensure that images available in a digital format cannot be processed to extract biometric templates, or to integrate them into biometric systems, without a specific legal basis for the new processing, when those images were initially captured for other purposes (from social media, for instance). As extracting biometric templates from digital images involves the processing of sensitive data, it is necessary to ensure the possible legal basis considered below, which varies according to the different sectors and uses. Specifically, using digital images that were uploaded onto the internet, including social media or online photo management websites, or that were captured by video surveillance cameras, cannot be considered lawful on the sole basis that the personal data were made manifestly available by the data subjects. ... Use of facial recognition technologies in the public sector Consent should not, as a rule, be the legal ground used for facial recognition performed by public authorities in view of the imbalance of powers between the data subjects and these authorities. ... Legislators and decision makers have to lay down specific rules for biometric processing using facial recognition technologies for law enforcement purposes. These rules will ensure that such uses must be strictly necessary and proportionate to these purposes and prescribe the necessary safeguards to be provided. Law enforcement authorities Biometric data processing using facial recognition technologies for identification purposes in a controlled or uncontrolled environment should be restricted, in general, to law enforcement purposes. It should be carried out solely by the competent authorities in the area of security. Laws may provide for different necessity and proportionality tests depending on whether the purpose is verification or identification, taking into account the potential risks to fundamental rights and as long as individuals\u2019 images are lawfully collected. For identification purposes, strict necessity and proportionality shall be observed both in the setting up of the database (watch list) and deployment of (live) facial recognition technologies in an uncontrolled environment. Laws should provide clear parameters and criteria that law enforcement authorities should adhere to when creating databases (watch lists) for specific, legitimate and explicit law enforcement purposes (for example, suspicion of severe offences or a risk to public security). Considering the intrusiveness of these technologies, in the deployment phase of the live facial recognition technologies in uncontrolled environments, the law shall ensure that law enforcement authorities demonstrate that a variety of factors, including the place and timing of deployment of these technologies, justify the strict necessity and proportionality of the uses. ...\u201d European Union"

Guidelines 05/2022 on the use of facial recognition technology in the area of law enforcement of 26 April 2023 by the European Data Protection Board provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201c36. The processing of biometric data under all circumstances constitutes a serious interference in itself. This does not depend on the outcome, e.g. a positive matching. The processing constitutes an interference even if the biometric template is immediately deleted after the matching against a police database results in a no-hit ... 43. Article 52(1) of the Charter sets the requirement of a specific legal basis. This legal basis must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication of the conditions and circumstances in which authorities are empowered to resort to any measures of collection of data and secret surveillance. It must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities so as to ensure individuals the minimum degree of protection as entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society. Moreover, lawfulness requires adequate safeguards to ensure that in particular an individual\u2019s right under Article 8 of the Charter is respected. These principles also apply to the processing of personal data for purposes of evaluating, training and further developing of FRT systems. 44. Given that biometric data when processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person constitute special categories of data listed in Article 10 LED, the different applications of FRT in most cases would require a dedicated law precisely describing the application and the conditions for its use. This encompasses in particular the types of crime and, where applicable, the appropriate threshold of severity of these crimes, in order to, among other things, effectively exclude petty crime ... 51. According to the CJEU\u2019s settled case-law, derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. This also implies that there are no less intrusive means available to achieve the purpose. Possible alternatives such as \u2013 depending on the given purpose \u2013 additional staffing, more frequent policing or additional street lighting have to be carefully identified and assessed. Legislative measures should differentiate and target those persons covered by it in the light of the objective, e.g. fighting serious crime. If it covers all persons in a general manner without such differentiation, limitation or exception, it intensifies the interference. It also intensifies the interference if the data processing covers a significant part of the population. 52. The protection of personal data resulting from the explicit obligation laid down in Article 8(1) of the Charter is especially important for the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter. Legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and impose safeguards so that the persons whose data have been processed have sufficient guarantees to effectively protect their personal data against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access or use of that data. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subject to automatic processing and where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to the data. Furthermore, internal or external, e.g. judicial, authorisation of the deployment of FRT may also contribute as safeguards, and may prove to be necessary in certain cases of severe interference. 53. The rules laid down have to be adapted to the specific situation, e.g. the quantity of data processed, the nature of the data and the risk of unlawful access to the data. This calls for rules which would serve, in particular, to govern the protection and security of the data in question in a clear and strict manner in order to ensure their full integrity and confidentiality. 54. With regard to the relationship between the controller and the processor it should not be permitted for the processors to have regard only to economic considerations when determining the level of security which they apply to personal data; this could endanger a sufficient high level of protection. 55. An act of law has to lay down substantive and procedural conditions and objective criteria by which to determine the limits of competent authorities\u2019 access to data and their subsequent use. For the purposes of prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions, the offences concerned would have to be considered sufficiently serious to justify the extent and seriousness of these interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined for example in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. 56. The data has to be processed in a way that ensures the applicability and effect of the EU data protection rules; in particular those provided by Article 8 of the Charter, which states that the compliance with the requirements of protection and security shall be subject to control by an independent authority. The geographical place where the processing takes place may in such a situation be relevant. 57. With regard to the different steps of processing of personal data, a distinction should be made between the categories of data on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned. The determination of the conditions of the processing, for example, the determination of the retention period, must be based on objective criteria in order to ensure that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. 58. Based on each situation, the assessment of necessity and proportionality has to identify and consider all implications that fall within the scope of other fundamental rights, such as human dignity under Article 1 of the Charter, freedom of thought, conscience and religion under Article 10 of the Charter, freedom of expression under Article 11 of the Charter as well as freedom of assembly and association under Article 12 of the Charter. 59. Furthermore, it has to be considered as a matter of severity, that if the data is systematically processed without the knowledge of the data subjects, it is likely to generate a general conception of constant surveillance. This may lead to chilling effects in regard of some or all of the fundamental rights concerned ... 73. Processing can only be regarded as \"strictly necessary\" if the interference to the protection of personal data and its restrictions is limited to what is absolutely necessary. The addition of the term \u201cstrictly\u201d means that the legislator intended the processing of special categories of data to only take place under conditions even stricter than the conditions for necessity. This requirement should be interpreted as being indispensable. It restricts the margin of appreciation permitted to the law enforcement authority in the necessity test to an absolute minimum. In accordance with the settled case-law of the CJEU, the condition of \u201cstrict necessity\u201d is also closely linked to the requirement of objective criteria in order to define the circumstances and conditions under which processing can be undertaken, thus excluding any processing of a general or systematic nature ... 104. The use of facial recognition technologies is intrinsically linked to processing of significant amounts of personal data, including special categories of data. The face and, more generally, biometric data are permanently and irrevocably linked to a person\u2019s identity. Therefore, the use of facial recognition has direct or indirect impact on a number of fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights that may go beyond privacy and data protection, such as human dignity, freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, and others. This is particularly relevant in the area of law enforcement and criminal justice. 105. The EDPB understands the need for law enforcement authorities to benefit from the best possible tools to quickly identify the perpetrators of terrorist acts and other serious crimes. However, such tools should be used in strict compliance with the applicable legal framework and only in cases when they satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality, as laid down in Article 52(1) of the Charter. Moreover, while modern technologies may be part of the solution, they are by no means a \u2018silver bullet\u2019. 106. There are certain use cases of facial recognition technologies, which pose unacceptably high risks to individuals and society (\u2018red lines\u2019). For these reasons the EDPB and the EDPS have called for their general ban. 107. In particular, remote biometric identification of individuals in publicly accessible spaces poses a high risk of intrusion into individuals\u2019 private lives and does not have a place in a democratic society, as by its nature, it entails mass surveillance. In the same vein, the EDPB considers AI-supported facial recognition systems categorising individuals based on their biometrics into clusters according to ethnicity, gender, as well as political or sexual orientation as not compatible with the Charter. Furthermore, the EDPB is convinced that the use of facial recognition or similar technologies, to infer emotions of a natural person is highly undesirable and should be prohibited, possibly with few duly justified exceptions. In addition, the EDPB considers that processing of personal data in a law enforcement context that would rely on a database populated by collection of personal data on a mass-scale and in an indiscriminate way, e.g. by \"scraping\" photographs and facial pictures accessible online, in particular those made available via social networks, would, as such, not meet the strict necessity requirement provided for by Union law.\u201d OTHER RELEVANT MATERIAL"

Furthermore, any use of audiovisual recording and facial recognition technology must be subject to robust and well-resourced oversight mechanisms. While part of the oversight can be carried out by independent and impartial data protection authorities, States should consider additional measures, including the involvement of an independent body, preferably of a judicial nature, in charge of authorizing the use of facial recognition technology measures in an assembly context. In any case, any use of recording and facial recognition technology should be open to judicial challenge. In all circumstances, the authorities should be transparent about the use of recording and facial recognition technology and always notify members of the public when they are, or may be, recorded and/or when their images may be processed in a facial recognition system. ... 53. In this context, the High Commissioner recommends that States: ... (h) Never use facial recognition technology to identify those peacefully participating in an assembly; (i) Refrain from recording footage of assembly participants, unless there are concrete indications that participants are engaging in, or will engage in, serious criminal activity, and such recording is provided by law, with the necessary robust safeguards;\u201d COUNCIL OF EUROPE 36 . Recommendation No. R (87) 15 of the Committee of Ministers regulating the use of personal data in the police sector (adopted on 17 September 1987) states, inter alia : \u201cPrinciple 2 \u2013 Collection of data 2.1. The collection of personal data for police purposes should be limited to such as is necessary for the prevention of a real danger or the suppression of a specific criminal offence. Any exception to this provision should be the subject of specific national legislation. ... 2.4. The collection of data on individuals solely on the basis that they have a particular racial origin, particular religious convictions, sexual behaviour or political opinions or belong to particular movements or organisations which are not proscribed by law should be prohibited. The collection of data concerning these factors may only be carried out if absolutely necessary for the purposes of a particular inquiry.\u201d 37 . The Guidelines on Facial Recognition (2021) by the Consultative Committee of the Convention for the protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (ETS 108) provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201cFacial recognition is the automatic processing of digital images containing individuals\u2019 faces for identification or verification of those individuals by using face templates. The sensitivity of information of a biometric nature was recognised explicitly with the inclusion of data uniquely identifying a person under the special categories of data in Article 6 of the modernised Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data (hereinafter \u2018Convention 108+\u2019). The context of the processing of images is relevant to the determination of the sensitive nature of the data, as not all processing of images involves the processing of sensitive data. Images shall only be covered by the definition of biometric data when they are processed through a specific technical means which permits the unique identification or authentication of an individual. These guidelines cover uses of facial recognition technologies, including live facial recognition technologies. ... Integrating facial recognition technologies into existing surveillance systems poses a serious risk to the rights to privacy and protection of personal data, as well as to other fundamental rights, since use of these technologies does not always require the awareness or co-operation of the individuals whose biometric data are processed in this way. This is the case, for instance, with the possibility to access digital images of individuals on the internet. In order to prevent such infringements, the parties to Convention 108+ shall ensure that the development and use of facial recognition respect the rights to privacy and personal data protection, thereby strengthening human rights and fundamental freedoms by implementing the principles enshrined in the Convention in the specific context of facial recognition technologies. ... Lawfulness As provided for by Article 6 of Convention 108+, the processing of special categories of data, such as biometric data, shall only be authorised if such processing relies on an appropriate legal basis, and if complementary and appropriate safeguards are enshrined in domestic law. These safeguards shall be adapted to the risks involved and to the interests, rights and freedoms to be protected. In some legislation, the prohibition of such processing is a rule and its implementation is allowed only by way of exception, in certain specific cases (for example, with the explicit consent of individuals, to protect their vital interests or when the processing is necessary for reasons of overriding public interest), and subject to safeguards that are appropriate to the risks involved. The necessity for the use of facial recognition technologies has to be assessed together with the proportionality to the purpose and the impact on the rights of the data subjects. The different cases of use should be categorised and a legal framework applicable to the processing of biometric data through facial recognition should be in place. This legal framework should address, for each different use, in particular: - a detailed explanation of the specific use and the intended purpose; - the minimum reliability and accuracy of the algorithm used; - the retention duration of the photos used; - the possibility of auditing these criteria; - the traceability of the process; - the safeguards. Strict limitation of certain uses by law The level of intrusiveness of facial recognition and related infringement of the rights to privacy and data protection will vary according to the particular use and there will be cases where domestic law will strictly limit or even completely prohibit its use where that decision has been reached through the democratic process. The use of live facial recognition technologies in uncontrolled environments, in light of its intrusiveness on the right to privacy and the dignity of individuals, coupled with the risk of an adverse impact on other human rights and fundamental freedoms, should be subject to a democratic debate and the possibility of a moratorium pending a full analysis. ... Integrating digital images into facial recognition technologies Legislators and decision makers shall ensure that images available in a digital format cannot be processed to extract biometric templates, or to integrate them into biometric systems, without a specific legal basis for the new processing, when those images were initially captured for other purposes (from social media, for instance). As extracting biometric templates from digital images involves the processing of sensitive data, it is necessary to ensure the possible legal basis considered below, which varies according to the different sectors and uses. Specifically, using digital images that were uploaded onto the internet, including social media or online photo management websites, or that were captured by video surveillance cameras, cannot be considered lawful on the sole basis that the personal data were made manifestly available by the data subjects. ... Use of facial recognition technologies in the public sector Consent should not, as a rule, be the legal ground used for facial recognition performed by public authorities in view of the imbalance of powers between the data subjects and these authorities. ... Legislators and decision makers have to lay down specific rules for biometric processing using facial recognition technologies for law enforcement purposes. These rules will ensure that such uses must be strictly necessary and proportionate to these purposes and prescribe the necessary safeguards to be provided. Law enforcement authorities Biometric data processing using facial recognition technologies for identification purposes in a controlled or uncontrolled environment should be restricted, in general, to law enforcement purposes. It should be carried out solely by the competent authorities in the area of security. Laws may provide for different necessity and proportionality tests depending on whether the purpose is verification or identification, taking into account the potential risks to fundamental rights and as long as individuals\u2019 images are lawfully collected. For identification purposes, strict necessity and proportionality shall be observed both in the setting up of the database (watch list) and deployment of (live) facial recognition technologies in an uncontrolled environment. Laws should provide clear parameters and criteria that law enforcement authorities should adhere to when creating databases (watch lists) for specific, legitimate and explicit law enforcement purposes (for example, suspicion of severe offences or a risk to public security). Considering the intrusiveness of these technologies, in the deployment phase of the live facial recognition technologies in uncontrolled environments, the law shall ensure that law enforcement authorities demonstrate that a variety of factors, including the place and timing of deployment of these technologies, justify the strict necessity and proportionality of the uses. ...\u201d European Union"

The geographical place where the processing takes place may in such a situation be relevant. 57. With regard to the different steps of processing of personal data, a distinction should be made between the categories of data on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned. The determination of the conditions of the processing, for example, the determination of the retention period, must be based on objective criteria in order to ensure that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. 58. Based on each situation, the assessment of necessity and proportionality has to identify and consider all implications that fall within the scope of other fundamental rights, such as human dignity under Article 1 of the Charter, freedom of thought, conscience and religion under Article 10 of the Charter, freedom of expression under Article 11 of the Charter as well as freedom of assembly and association under Article 12 of the Charter. 59. Furthermore, it has to be considered as a matter of severity, that if the data is systematically processed without the knowledge of the data subjects, it is likely to generate a general conception of constant surveillance. This may lead to chilling effects in regard of some or all of the fundamental rights concerned ... 73. Processing can only be regarded as \"strictly necessary\" if the interference to the protection of personal data and its restrictions is limited to what is absolutely necessary. The addition of the term \u201cstrictly\u201d means that the legislator intended the processing of special categories of data to only take place under conditions even stricter than the conditions for necessity. This requirement should be interpreted as being indispensable. It restricts the margin of appreciation permitted to the law enforcement authority in the necessity test to an absolute minimum. In accordance with the settled case-law of the CJEU, the condition of \u201cstrict necessity\u201d is also closely linked to the requirement of objective criteria in order to define the circumstances and conditions under which processing can be undertaken, thus excluding any processing of a general or systematic nature ... 104. The use of facial recognition technologies is intrinsically linked to processing of significant amounts of personal data, including special categories of data. The face and, more generally, biometric data are permanently and irrevocably linked to a person\u2019s identity. Therefore, the use of facial recognition has direct or indirect impact on a number of fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights that may go beyond privacy and data protection, such as human dignity, freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, and others. This is particularly relevant in the area of law enforcement and criminal justice. 105. The EDPB understands the need for law enforcement authorities to benefit from the best possible tools to quickly identify the perpetrators of terrorist acts and other serious crimes. However, such tools should be used in strict compliance with the applicable legal framework and only in cases when they satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality, as laid down in Article 52(1) of the Charter. Moreover, while modern technologies may be part of the solution, they are by no means a \u2018silver bullet\u2019. 106. There are certain use cases of facial recognition technologies, which pose unacceptably high risks to individuals and society (\u2018red lines\u2019). For these reasons the EDPB and the EDPS have called for their general ban. 107. In particular, remote biometric identification of individuals in publicly accessible spaces poses a high risk of intrusion into individuals\u2019 private lives and does not have a place in a democratic society, as by its nature, it entails mass surveillance. In the same vein, the EDPB considers AI-supported facial recognition systems categorising individuals based on their biometrics into clusters according to ethnicity, gender, as well as political or sexual orientation as not compatible with the Charter. Furthermore, the EDPB is convinced that the use of facial recognition or similar technologies, to infer emotions of a natural person is highly undesirable and should be prohibited, possibly with few duly justified exceptions. In addition, the EDPB considers that processing of personal data in a law enforcement context that would rely on a database populated by collection of personal data on a mass-scale and in an indiscriminate way, e.g. by \"scraping\" photographs and facial pictures accessible online, in particular those made available via social networks, would, as such, not meet the strict necessity requirement provided for by Union law.\u201d OTHER RELEVANT MATERIAL"

Guidelines 05/2022 on the use of facial recognition technology in the area of law enforcement of 26 April 2023 by the European Data Protection Board provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201c36. The processing of biometric data under all circumstances constitutes a serious interference in itself. This does not depend on the outcome, e.g. a positive matching. The processing constitutes an interference even if the biometric template is immediately deleted after the matching against a police database results in a no-hit ... 43. Article 52(1) of the Charter sets the requirement of a specific legal basis. This legal basis must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication of the conditions and circumstances in which authorities are empowered to resort to any measures of collection of data and secret surveillance. It must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities so as to ensure individuals the minimum degree of protection as entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society. Moreover, lawfulness requires adequate safeguards to ensure that in particular an individual\u2019s right under Article 8 of the Charter is respected. These principles also apply to the processing of personal data for purposes of evaluating, training and further developing of FRT systems. 44. Given that biometric data when processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person constitute special categories of data listed in Article 10 LED, the different applications of FRT in most cases would require a dedicated law precisely describing the application and the conditions for its use. This encompasses in particular the types of crime and, where applicable, the appropriate threshold of severity of these crimes, in order to, among other things, effectively exclude petty crime ... 51. According to the CJEU\u2019s settled case-law, derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. This also implies that there are no less intrusive means available to achieve the purpose. Possible alternatives such as \u2013 depending on the given purpose \u2013 additional staffing, more frequent policing or additional street lighting have to be carefully identified and assessed. Legislative measures should differentiate and target those persons covered by it in the light of the objective, e.g. fighting serious crime. If it covers all persons in a general manner without such differentiation, limitation or exception, it intensifies the interference. It also intensifies the interference if the data processing covers a significant part of the population. 52. The protection of personal data resulting from the explicit obligation laid down in Article 8(1) of the Charter is especially important for the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter. Legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and impose safeguards so that the persons whose data have been processed have sufficient guarantees to effectively protect their personal data against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access or use of that data. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subject to automatic processing and where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to the data. Furthermore, internal or external, e.g. judicial, authorisation of the deployment of FRT may also contribute as safeguards, and may prove to be necessary in certain cases of severe interference. 53. The rules laid down have to be adapted to the specific situation, e.g. the quantity of data processed, the nature of the data and the risk of unlawful access to the data. This calls for rules which would serve, in particular, to govern the protection and security of the data in question in a clear and strict manner in order to ensure their full integrity and confidentiality. 54. With regard to the relationship between the controller and the processor it should not be permitted for the processors to have regard only to economic considerations when determining the level of security which they apply to personal data; this could endanger a sufficient high level of protection. 55. An act of law has to lay down substantive and procedural conditions and objective criteria by which to determine the limits of competent authorities\u2019 access to data and their subsequent use. For the purposes of prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions, the offences concerned would have to be considered sufficiently serious to justify the extent and seriousness of these interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined for example in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. 56. The data has to be processed in a way that ensures the applicability and effect of the EU data protection rules; in particular those provided by Article 8 of the Charter, which states that the compliance with the requirements of protection and security shall be subject to control by an independent authority. The geographical place where the processing takes place may in such a situation be relevant. 57. With regard to the different steps of processing of personal data, a distinction should be made between the categories of data on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned. The determination of the conditions of the processing, for example, the determination of the retention period, must be based on objective criteria in order to ensure that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. 58. Based on each situation, the assessment of necessity and proportionality has to identify and consider all implications that fall within the scope of other fundamental rights, such as human dignity under Article 1 of the Charter, freedom of thought, conscience and religion under Article 10 of the Charter, freedom of expression under Article 11 of the Charter as well as freedom of assembly and association under Article 12 of the Charter. 59. Furthermore, it has to be considered as a matter of severity, that if the data is systematically processed without the knowledge of the data subjects, it is likely to generate a general conception of constant surveillance. This may lead to chilling effects in regard of some or all of the fundamental rights concerned ... 73.

    "answer": "The assessment of the disturbance actually caused by the assembly is all the more important in an ambiguous situation, such as gatherings not clearly falling under the domestic regulations. If there is doubt whether a particular event constitutes a form of assembly calling for notification or authorisation under the domestic law the authorities must adopt measures based on the degree of disturbance caused by the impugned conduct and not on formal grounds, such as non-compliance with the notification procedure. An interference with the freedom of an assembly involving its disruption, dispersal or the arrest of participants may only be justifiable on specific and averred substantive grounds, such as serious risks provided for by law (Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, \u00a7 136). The State has a positive obligation to protect the right to freedom of assembly of both demonstrating groups, and should find the least restrictive means that would, in principle, enable both demonstrations to take place (F\u00e1ber v. Hungary, 2012, \u00a7 43). The Court must be satisfied that in exercising the discretion afforded to the authorities by domestic law they acted in a manner compatible with the essence of the right to freedom of assembly, and, where relevant, with due recognition of the privileged protection under the Convention of political speech, debate on questions of public interest and the peaceful manifestation on such matters. A decision to disperse an assembly must be justified by relevant and sufficient reasons (Ibrahimov and Others v. Azerbaijan, 2016, \u00a7 80; Laguna Guzman v. Spain, 2020, \u00a7 51). The non-compliance of the assembly with the formal requirements for holding it is not sufficient for its dispersal (see Section F (2): Unlawful assembly). An interference with the freedom of an assembly involving its disruption, dispersal or the arrest of participants may only be justifiable on specific and averred substantive grounds, such as serious risks provided for by law (Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, \u00a7 137), and only after the participants had been given sufficient opportunity to manifest their views (\u00c9va Moln\u00e1r v. Hungary, 2008, \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 43).",

Turkey, no. 73333/01, \u00a7 51, 6 March 2007). In this respect, the instant case is different from others where the dispersal was quite prompt (see Bukta and Others, cited above, \u00a7 10; Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no.\u00a074552/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-42, ECHR 2006XIV; Bal\u00e7\u0131k and Others, cited above, \u00a7 51)."

They also noted that, together with other demonstrators, the applicant had not complied with the order to disperse. In those circumstances, and taking into account the margin of appreciation afforded to States in this sphere, the Government considered that the risk of disruption to civilians who were in the park at a busy time of day and the demonstrators\u2019 resistance justified the dispersal of the gathering in question. In their opinion, the police intervention had been a necessary measure within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 11 of the Convention."

RUSSIA; \u00a7 53: As regards the termination of the demonstration, it appears that the justification for that decision and the manner of its implementation were not subject to judicial assessment in the domestic proceedings. The domestic courts abstained from examining the wider context of the applicant\u2019s arrest (see paragraph 18 above) and her arguments about the unlawfulness of the order to disperse; likewise, they did not address her defence argument that it had been impossible to leave the venue of the assembly owing to the general commotion. It follows that no domestic balancing exercise was carried out, which would have allowed the Russian courts to weigh considerations of \u201cprevention of disorder\u201d or \u201cprotection of the rights and freedoms of others\u201d against the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of peaceful assembly. Accordingly, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s situation was not substantially different from that of Mr Frumkin, and that the dispersal of the demonstration involving the applicant\u2019s arrest had a similar chilling effect, that is, of discouraging her and others from attending protest rallies. It concludes that the security measures implemented at the site of the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square, its early termination and the dispersal amounted to a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of peaceful assembly."

        "answer": "Answer: The State's use of discretion in justifying disruption, dispersal, or arrest of participants in an assembly is bound by the Convention's stringent principles, and State authorities are under an obligation to consider the margin of appreciation and positive obligations to ensure the right to freedom of assembly is effectively applied.\nThe State must provide specific and averred substantive grounds that justify any interference with the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, which should not exceed the permissible limitations.\n[/INST] Question: In the context of dispersing an assembly, how are the principles of Article 14 and Article 10 of the Convention applied in practice, and when does the interference with the right to freedom of peaceful assembly become disproportionate?\nAnswer: Article 14 of the Convention provides authorities with powers and duties in connection with the holding of an assembly, while Article 10 establishes the limitations on public speech, debate, and the expression of opinions.\nThe application of these principles in practice requires a delicate balance between the interests of individuals and public order.\nWhen the authorities issue orders to disperse and arrest participants who fail to comply, these actions are justified if they are based on specific and averred substantive grounds, such as serious risks.\nThe disruption, dispersal, or arrest of participants can become disproportionate if the consequences of the interference do not justify the measures taken by the authorities, or if the authorities fail to consider the margin of appreciation and positive obligations in their actions.\n[/INST] Question: Did the domestic courts strike the right balance between the interests of the applicants and the public order in the cases under discussion?\nAnswer: The Court observes that the domestic courts did not strike a fair balance between the interests of the applicants and the public order in the three cases under discussion.\nThe courts failed to consider the margin of appreciation and positive obligations in their actions, and failed to conduct a balancing assessment between the interests of the applicants in exercising their right to freedom of peaceful assembly, and those of the authorities in ensuring public order.\nThe interferences in the form of prosecution for failing to comply with orders to disperse were not justified with reference to specific and averred substantive grounds.\nThis failure to strike the right balance led to unjustified infringements on the applicants' rights.\n[/INST] Question: What is the Court's assessment of the police's use of force in dispersing crowds and arresting participants for failing to comply with orders to disperse in the cases discussed?\nAnswer: The Court held that the police's use of force in dispersing crowds and arresting participants must be based on specific and averred substantive grounds.\nIn the three cases under discussion, the police did not clearly justify their actions with such grounds.\nThe Court further noted that the police should have considered the margin of appreciation and positive obligations in their actions to respect the essence of the right to freedom of assembly, and the privileged protection under the Convention of political speech, debate on questions of public interest, and the peaceful expression of opinions.\n[/INST] Question: In what circumstances is an immediate response to a current political event by way of a demonstration considered a necessary infringement on the right to hold spontaneous demonstrations?\nAnswer: An immediate response to a current political event by way of a demonstration may be considered a necessary infringement on the right to hold spontaneous demonstrations if it warrants a demonstration in the form of a spontaneous peaceful assembly.\nThe right to hold spontaneous demonstrations may override the obligation to give prior notification to public assemblies when there is an immediate response to a current political event.\nThis means that in some circumstances, the freedom of assembly can be prioritised over the requirement to give prior notice, allowing for a more responsive approach to political events.\n[/INST] Question: According to the K\u00faria's report, how did the police handle the demonstration in the three cases under discussion?\nDid they strike a fair balance between the right to freedom of assembly and the potential disruption caused by the impugned conduct?\nAnswer: According to the K\u00faria's report on the three cases under discussion, the police handled the demonstration by issuing orders to disperse.\nHowever, the Court found that the courts did not strike a fair balance between the right to freedom of assembly and the potential disruption caused by the impugned conduct.\nThe courts failed to consider the margin of appreciation and positive obligations in their actions and failed to conduct a balancing assessment between the interests of the applicants and the authorities.",

In its judgments of 23 September 2015 and 6 January 2016 the K\u00faria reiterated that under the Freedom of Assembly Act no. III of 1989 the dispersal of demonstrations was a possibility rather than an obligation for the police and restrictions on the fundamental rights of others did not in themselves justify the restriction of the right of assembly. Furthermore, dispersal could only be used as a last resort, if the demonstration was likely to entail serious consequences. Relying on the report by the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights, the K\u00faria considered that despite certain violent actions, the demonstration had on the whole remained peaceful. The court went on to find that the police had been under an obligation to respect the principle of proportionality and had been right to conclude that dispersing the march could have caused more serious prejudice to the Roma community than allowing the demonstration to continue in a controlled manner."

The domestic courts abstained from examining the wider context of the applicant\u2019s arrest (see paragraph 18 above) and her arguments about the unlawfulness of the order to disperse; likewise, they did not address her defence argument that it had been impossible to leave the venue of the assembly owing to the general commotion.

Accordingly, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s situation was not substantially different from that of Mr Frumkin, and that the dispersal of the demonstration involving the applicant\u2019s arrest had a similar chilling effect, that is, of discouraging her and others from attending protest rallies. It concludes that the security measures implemented at the site of the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square, its early termination and the dispersal amounted to a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of peaceful assembly."

RUSSIA; \u00a7 375: The applicants further argued that under Russian law, if a public event was held at a location, time or in a manner not approved by the authorities that event could be dispersed by the police and its organisers and the participants brought to liability for an administrative offence of a breach of the established procedure for the conduct of public events. Under Russian law the recourse to forced dispersal was not limited to cases of violent assemblies or assemblies presenting danger to public order or public safety; the mere fact of unlawfulness of a public event was sufficient to legitimise its dispersal under the domestic law. The Court had however already found that the fact that the assembly was unlawful did not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no.\u00a074552/01, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2006XIII). It was important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention was not to be deprived of its substance (see Malofeyeva v. Russia, no. 36673/04, \u00a7 136, 30\u00a0May 2013). In the applicants\u2019 opinion, the mere failure to comply with the restrictions on the location, time or manner of conduct of a public event imposed by the authorities did not justify its dispersal. Such dispersal could be justified only when it was applied as a measure of last resort where there was an imminent threat of violence and where other reasonable measures to facilitate and protect the assembly from harm (for example, by quieting violent individuals) had proved ineffective (they referred to \u00a7\u00a7 165 and 166 of the OSCE/ODIHR Guidelines, cited in paragraph 317 above). A blanket use of dispersals for non-violent assemblies by the Russian authorities might not be considered \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d."

The domestic courts abstained from examining the wider context of the applicant\u2019s arrest (see paragraph 18 above) and her arguments about the unlawfulness of the order to disperse; likewise, they did not address her defence argument that it had been impossible to leave the venue of the assembly owing to the general commotion.

Accordingly, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s situation was not substantially different from that of Mr Frumkin, and that the dispersal of the demonstration involving the applicant\u2019s arrest had a similar chilling effect, that is, of discouraging her and others from attending protest rallies. It concludes that the security measures implemented at the site of the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square, its early termination and the dispersal amounted to a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of peaceful assembly."

Examining the domestic approach to dispersal of demonstrations, it appears that the police have a similar obligation to disband an assembly if the exercise of the right of assembly constitutes a criminal offence or a call to commit such an offence, or if it violates the rights and freedoms of others, as demonstrated by the judgment of the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 35 above)."

    "question": "How does the Court determine whether a State has fulfilled its positive obligation to issue travel documents and ensure the right to enter under Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 4, considering the diverse situations in the Contracting States and the State's margin of appreciation in choosing practical measures?",
    "answer": "As regards the implementation of the right to enter guaranteed by Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 4, and as in other contexts, the scope of any positive obligations will inevitably vary, depending on the diverse situations in the Contracting States and the choices to be made in terms of priorities and resources. Those obligations must not be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities. As to the choice of particular practical measures, where the State is required to take positive measures, the choice of means is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State\u2019s margin of appreciation. There are different avenues for securing Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided for by domestic law, it may still have fulfilled its positive obligation by other means (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7 252). Some positive obligations correspond to measures which stem traditionally from the State\u2019s obligation to issue travel documents to nationals, to ensure that they can cross the border (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7\u00a7 251 and 260). In some cases, nationals can be deprived of the right to enter for the reason that the respondent State did not carry out the formalities required by domestic law and international rules to guarantee their entry or because it failed to issue the requisite travel documents to allow them to cross the border and to ensure they could return (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7 207). However, any such requirement must be interpreted narrowly and will be binding on States only in exceptional circumstances, for example where extraterritorial factors directly threaten the life and physical well-being of a child in a situation of extreme vulnerability. In addition, when examining whether a State has failed to fulfil its positive obligation to guarantee the effective exercise of the right to enter its territory, under Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 4, where such exceptional circumstances exist, the requisite review will be confined to ensuring effective protection against arbitrariness in the State\u2019s discharge of its positive obligation under that provision (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7 261). The Court is aware of the varying approaches adopted by States, which seek to reconcile the imperatives of their governmental policies and respect for their legal obligations under national or international law. However, the Court must ascertain that the exercise by the State of its discretionary power is compatible with the fundamental principles of the rule of law and prohibition of arbitrariness, principles which underlie the Convention as a whole (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7 262).",

This is not a case where those concerned have been deprived of the right to enter for the reason that the respondent State did not carry out the formalities required by domestic law and international rules to guarantee their entry, or because it failed to issue the requisite travel documents to allow them to cross the border and to ensure they could return (compare, for example, Marangos v. Cyprus, no.\u00a031106/96, Commission decision of 20 May 1997, unreported, and Mom\u010dilovi\u0107 v. Croatia (dec.), no.\u00a059138/00, 29 August 2002). Such a decision does not therefore fall within the exercise by the State of its ordinary public powers in policing the border, a circumstance which would suffice to bring the applicants\u2019 family members \u2013 French nationals \u2013 within the territorial jurisdiction of France, which begins at the line forming the border (see N.D. and N.T. v. Spain [GC], nos.\u00a08675/15 and 8697/15, \u00a7 109, 13\u00a0February 2020). The Court refers here in particular to the position of the Government which, in their written observations on the complaint under Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 4 and at the hearing, indicated that if the applicants\u2019 daughters and grandchildren were to arrive at the border they would not be turned away and would be allowed to enter France (see paragraph 218 below).",

These correspond to measures which stem traditionally from the State\u2019s obligation to issue travel documents to nationals, to ensure that they can cross the border (see, for example, Marangos, and Mom\u010dilovi\u0107, both cited above).",

Romania [GC], no. 80982/12, \u00a7\u00a0122, 15\u00a0October 2020, and the cases cited in paragraph 208 above). Furthermore, the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed may, in certain circumstances, require the State to take operational measures (see, among many other authorities, Kurt v.\u00a0Austria [GC], no. 62903/15, \u00a7\u00a7 157 et seq., 15\u00a0June 2021). Without calling into question the \u201cabsolute\u201d nature of the right to enter guaranteed by Article\u00a03 \u00a7\u00a02 of Protocol No.\u00a04, which contains no express restrictions, the Court would again emphasise that, as regards the implementation of this right, and as in other contexts, the scope of any positive obligations will inevitably vary, depending on the diverse situations in the Contracting States and the choices to be made in terms of priorities and resources. Those obligations must not be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v. Switzerland (no. 2) [GC], no. 32772/02, \u00a7 81, ECHR 2009; Kurt, cited above, \u00a7 158; and X and Others v. Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7 182).

One example is the obligation to issue them with travel documents to enable them to cross a border. The Court further points out that, as can be seen from the preparatory work on Protocol No. 4, the object of the right to enter the territory of a State of which one is a national is to prohibit the exile of nationals, a measure of banishment that has, at certain times in history, been enforced against specific categories of individuals (see paragraph\u00a0126 above). Seen from this perspective, it considers that Article\u00a03 \u00a7\u00a02 of Protocol No.\u00a04 may impose a positive obligation on the State where, in view of the specificities of a given case, a refusal by that State to take any action would leave the national concerned in a situation comparable, de facto, to that of exile.",

In addition, when examining whether a State has failed to fulfil its positive obligation to guarantee the effective exercise of the right to enter its territory, under Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No.\u00a04, where such exceptional circumstances exist, the requisite review will be confined to ensuring effective protection against arbitrariness in the State\u2019s discharge of its positive obligation under that provision.",

RUSSIA; \u00a7 84: Having regard to the absolute character of the protection guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention and given its fundamental importance in the Convention system, the Court has developed a test for cases concerning a State\u2019s positive obligation under that Convention provision. In particular, it has held that to successfully argue a violation of his Article 3 right it would be sufficient for an applicant to demonstrate that the authorities had not taken all steps which could have been reasonably expected of them to prevent real and immediate risks to the applicant\u2019s physical integrity, of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge. The test does not, however, require it to be shown that \u201cbut for\u201d the failing or omission of the public authority the ill-treatment would not have occurred. The answer to the question whether the authorities fulfilled their positive obligation under Article 3 will depend on all the circumstances of the case under examination (see Pantea, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 191-96). The Court also reiterates that State responsibility is engaged by a failure to take reasonably available measures which could have had a real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm to the applicant (see E. and Others v. the , no. 33218/96, \u00a7\u00a7 89-101, 26 November 2002). The Court therefore has to establish whether, in the circumstances of the present case, the authorities knew or ought to have known that the first applicant was suffering or at risk of being subjected to ill-treatment at the hands of his cellmates, and if so, whether the administration of the detention facility, within the limits of their official powers, took reasonable steps to eliminate those risks and to protect the first applicant from that abuse."

Romania, no. 80982/12, \u00a7\u00a0122, 15\u00a0October 2020, and the cases cited in paragraph 208 above). Furthermore, the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed may, in certain circumstances, require the State to take operational measures (see, among many other authorities, Kurt v.\u00a0Austria, no. 62903/15, \u00a7\u00a7 157 et seq., 15\u00a0June 2021). Without calling into question the \u201cabsolute\u201d nature of the right to enter guaranteed by Article\u00a03 \u00a7\u00a02 of Protocol No.\u00a04, which contains no express restrictions, the Court would again emphasise that, as regards the implementation of this right, and as in other contexts, the scope of any positive obligations will inevitably vary, depending on the diverse situations in the Contracting States and the choices to be made in terms of priorities and resources. Those obligations must not be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v. Switzerland (no. 2), no. 32772/02, \u00a7 81, ECHR 2009; Kurt, cited above, \u00a7 158; and X and Others v. Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7 182). As to the choice of particular practical measures, the Court has consistently held that where the State is required to take positive measures, the choice of means is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State\u2019s margin of appreciation. There are different avenues for securing Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided for by domestic law, it may still have fulfilled its positive obligation by other means (see Budayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 15339/02 and 4 others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0134 and\u00a0135, ECHR 2008, and Lopes de Sousa Fernandes v.\u00a0Portugal, no.\u00a056080/13, \u00a7\u00a0216, 19 December 2017)."

FRANCE; \u00a7 260: Even though Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 4 does not guarantee a general right to repatriation for the benefit of nationals of a State who are outside its borders (see paragraphs 255-259 above), the Court would refer to its earlier acknowledgment that this provision may impose on a State certain positive obligations vis-\u00e0-vis its nationals in order to ensure that their right to enter national territory is practical and effective (see paragraphs 251 and 252 above). One example is the obligation to issue them with travel documents to enable them to cross a border. The Court further points out that, as can be seen from the preparatory work on Protocol No. 4, the object of the right to enter the territory of a State of which one is a national is to prohibit the exile of nationals, a measure of banishment that has, at certain times in history, been enforced against specific categories of individuals (see paragraph\u00a0126 above). Seen from this perspective, it considers that Article\u00a03 \u00a7\u00a02 of Protocol No.\u00a04 may impose a positive obligation on the State where, in view of the specificities of a given case, a refusal by that State to take any action would leave the national concerned in a situation comparable, de facto, to that of exile."

RUSSIA; \u00a7 84: Having regard to the absolute character of the protection guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention and given its fundamental importance in the Convention system, the Court has developed a test for cases concerning a State\u2019s positive obligation under that Convention provision. In particular, it has held that to successfully argue a violation of his Article 3 right it would be sufficient for an applicant to demonstrate that the authorities had not taken all steps which could have been reasonably expected of them to prevent real and immediate risks to the applicant\u2019s physical integrity, of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge. The test does not, however, require it to be shown that \u201cbut for\u201d the failing or omission of the public authority the ill-treatment would not have occurred. The answer to the question whether the authorities fulfilled their positive obligation under Article 3 will depend on all the circumstances of the case under examination (see Pantea, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 191-96). The Court also reiterates that State responsibility is engaged by a failure to take reasonably available measures which could have had a real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm to the applicant (see E. and Others v. the , no. 33218/96, \u00a7\u00a7 89-101, 26 November 2002). The Court therefore has to establish whether, in the circumstances of the present case, the authorities knew or ought to have known that the first applicant was suffering or at risk of being subjected to ill-treatment at the hands of his cellmates, and if so, whether the administration of the detention facility, within the limits of their official powers, took reasonable steps to eliminate those risks and to protect the first applicant from that abuse."

    "question": "How does the Court differentiate between applicants and victims in cases involving derogation from Convention obligations under Article 15, and what criteria does the Court consider in determining whether the conditions for derogation are met based on the specific facts of the case?",
    "answer": "It is for the Court to determine the significance to be attached to those circumstances and to ascertain whether the balance struck complied with the applicable provisions of the relevant article, in the light of their particular wording and the article\u2019s overall object and purpose (Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, 1988, \u00a7 48, in respect of Article 5). For this reason, in any case where an applicant complains that his or her Convention rights were violated during a period of derogation, the Court will first examine whether the measures taken can be justified under the substantive articles of the Convention; it is only if it cannot be so justified that the Court will go on to determine whether the derogation was valid (see, for instance, A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2009, \u00a7 161; Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 1978, \u00a7 191; Lawless v. Ireland (no. 3), 1961, \u00a7 15). This does not, however, preclude proper account being taken of the background circumstances of the case.",

This it does by giving judgments and decisions interpreting the provisions of the Convention in specific cases on the basis of applications submitted under Articles 33 and 34 of the Convention by High Contracting Parties and persons, non-governmental organisations or groups of individuals claiming to be victims of violations of their rights, respectively, and by giving advisory opinions on questions within its competence under Article 47 of the Convention at the request of the Committee of Ministers (see, in particular, Salah v. the Netherlands, no. 8196/02, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2006IX (extracts); see also Loizidou v. Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, \u00a7 70, Series A no. 310)."

The Court notes that the provisions of the Convention are to be interpreted in a manner which renders its safeguards practical and effective.

    "answer": "This positive obligation to protect is to be interpreted in such a way as not to impose an excessive burden on the authorities, bearing in mind, in particular, the unpredictability of human conduct and operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources. Accordingly, not every risk of ill-treatment could entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take measures to prevent that risk from materialising. However, the required measures should, at least, provide effective protection in particular of children and other vulnerable persons and should include reasonable steps to prevent ill-treatment of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge (O\u2019Keeffe v. Ireland [GC], 2014, \u00a7 144). The Court observes that in this context, the assessment of the nature and level of risk constitutes an integral part of the duty to take preventive operational measures where the presence of a risk so requires. Thus, an examination of the State\u2019s compliance with this duty must comprise an analysis of both the adequacy of the assessment of risk conducted by the domestic authorities and, where a relevant risk triggering the duty to act was or ought to have been identified, the adequacy of the preventive measures taken (Kurt v. Austria [GC], 2021, \u00a7 159, albeit under Article 2 of the Convention). The Court has also underlined that it is not necessary to show that \u201cbut for\u201d the State omission the ill-treatment would not have happened. A failure to take reasonably available measures which could have had a real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm is sufficient to engage the responsibility of the State (O\u2019Keeffe v. Ireland [GC], 2014, \u00a7 149).",

It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The obligation on High Contracting Parties under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 3, requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, including such ill-treatment administered by private individuals. This positive obligation to protect is to be interpreted in such a way as not to impose an excessive burden on the authorities, bearing in mind, in particular, the unpredictability of human conduct and operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources.

The Court emphasizes that the State has an ongoing duty to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of children in their care, and in cases where such individuals are in a particularly vulnerable situation, the obligation imposed on the authorities to take preventive operational measures is heightened, requiring them to exercise particular vigilance ([Doc 2]).\n    2. The duty to take preventive operational measures under Article 2 is an obligation of means, not of result, and the failure to achieve the desired result in itself may not justify a finding of a violation of the State's preventive operational obligation under Article 2.\nHowever, the assessment of the nature and level of risk constitutes an integral part of this duty ([Doc 1]).\n    3. The Court recognizes that it is impossible to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities, given the difficulties involved in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct, and the operational choices required by the authorities to prioritize resources ([Doc 9, Doc 8]).\n    4. The Court refers to cases such as Osman, L.C.B., Keenan, and Renolde v. France to support its position that not every claimed risk to life warrants the State's obligation to take preventive operational measures ([Doc 1, Doc 4, Doc 3, Doc 8]).\n5.\nThe Court applies the Osman test, which requires that the State knew or ought to have known of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual from the criminal acts of a third party.\nIf the State fails to take measures within the scope of their powers, which could have been reasonably expected to avoid that risk, a violation of the duty under Article 2 may be established ([Doc 9]).\n6.\nThe Court emphasizes that the scope of the positive obligation is determined by the risks posed in a particular case, and a failure to act does not necessarily entail a violation of Article 2.\nHowever, if the State had knowledge of a risk, it must be established whether they took all steps that could have been reasonably expected of them to prevent that risk from materialising (L.C.B., cited above, \u00a7\u00a038, para 9).\n    7. The assessment of the adequacy of the State's measures includes examining both the adequacy of the assessment of risk conducted by domestic authorities and their compliance with their duty under Article 2 by considering the preventive measures taken ([Doc 8]).\n    8. The Court stresses the importance of a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for prevention, suppression, and punishment of breaches ([Doc 3]).\n9.\nThe Court acknowledges that a real-life danger has been identified, and no-action from the authorities would render the risk foreseeable and the omission of preventive measures in the context of special diligence a violation of their positive obligation under the Osman test.\nHowever, in cases where the risk assessed by authorities is not followed by a standardised risk assessment procedure, it must be found that the assessment fulfilled the requirements of being autonomous, proactive, and comprehensive ([Doc 5]).\n    10. The Supreme Court's decision to issue a barring and protection order is also validated, as it shows that the risks identified were serious enough to warrant such measures ([Doc 6]).\nThese principles and considerations guide the Court when assessing the adequacy of State's preventive operational measures and risk assessments in fulfilling its duty to protect individuals from ill-treatment.",

This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions.

The risk did not need to come to pass in order for that positive obligation to be imposed on the State.

In these circumstances the Court considers that the obligation imposed on the authorities by Article 3 of the Convention to take preventive operational measures where they have, or ought to have, knowledge of a risk that a child may be subjected to illtreatment, was heightened in the present case and required the authorities in question to exercise particular vigilance. It must therefore ascertain whether, in the particular case, the authorities of the respondent State knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the applicants of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 and, if so, whether they took all the measures that could reasonably be expected of them to avoid that risk (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, \u00a7 116)."

In particular, it has held that to successfully argue a violation of his Article 3 right it would be sufficient for an applicant to demonstrate that the authorities had not taken all steps which could have been reasonably expected of them to prevent real and immediate risks to the applicant\u2019s physical integrity, of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge. The test does not, however, require it to be shown that \u201cbut for\u201d the failing or omission of the public authority the ill-treatment would not have occurred. The answer to the question whether the authorities fulfilled their positive obligation under Article 3 will depend on all the circumstances of the case under examination (see Pantea, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 191-96). The Court also reiterates that State responsibility is engaged by a failure to take reasonably available measures which could have had a real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm to the applicant (see E. and Others v. the , no. 33218/96, \u00a7\u00a7 89-101, 26 November 2002).

This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. It also extends in appropriate circumstances to a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual from another individual or, in particular circumstances, from himself (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 115, Reports 1998VIII; Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2001-III; and Renolde v.
